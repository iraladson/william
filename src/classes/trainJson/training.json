        "This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.",
        "Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,",
        "Judah the father of Perez and Zerah (by Tamar), Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,",
        "Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,",
        "Salmon the father of Boaz (by Rahab), Boaz the father of Obed (by Ruth), Obed the father of Jesse,",

        "Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,",
        "Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah,",
        "Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,",
        "Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,",
        "and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.",
        "After the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,",
        "Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,",

        "Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,",
        "and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.",
        "So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations.",
        "Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.",
        "Because Joseph, her husband to be, was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her privately.",
        "When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,",
        "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.",
        "She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.",
        "This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:",
        "Look! The virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call him Emmanuel, which means",
        "God with us.",
        "When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife,",
        "but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.",
        "After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the time of King Herod, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem",
        "saying,",
        "Where is the one who is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.",
        "When King Herod heard this he was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him.",
        "After assembling all the chief priests and experts in the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.",
        "In Bethlehem of Judea, they said,",
        "for it is written this way by the prophet:",
        "‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are in no way least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’",
        "Then Herod privately summoned the wise men and determined from them when the star had appeared.",
        "He sent them to Bethlehem and said,",
        "Go and look carefully for the child. When you find him, inform me so that I can go and worship him as well.",
        "After listening to the king they left, and once again the star they saw when it rose led them until it stopped above the place where the child was.",
        "When they saw the star they shouted joyfully.",
        "As they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasure boxes and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.",
        "After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back by another route to their own country.",
        "After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said,",
        "Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to look for the child to kill him.",
        "Then he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and went to Egypt.",
        "He stayed there until Herod died. In this way what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet was fulfilled:",
        "I called my Son out of Egypt.",
        "When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became enraged. He sent men to kill all the children in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding region from the age of two and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men.",
        "Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:",
        "A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud wailing, Rachel weeping for her children, and she did not want to be comforted, because they were gone.",
        "After Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt",
        "saying,",
        "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child’s life are dead.",
        "So he got up and took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel.",
        "But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the regions of Galilee.",
        "He came to a town called Nazareth and lived there. Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.",
        "In those days John the Baptist came into the wilderness of Judea proclaiming,",
        "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.",
        "For he is the one about whom Isaiah the prophet had spoken:",
        "The voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight.’",
        "Now John wore clothing made from camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.",
        "Then people from Jerusalem, as well as all Judea and all the region around the Jordan, were going out to him,",
        "and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.",
        "But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them,",
        "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?",
        "Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance,",
        "and don’t think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones!",
        "Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.",
        "I baptize you with water, for repentance, but the one coming after me is more powerful than I am &#8211; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.",
        "His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with inextinguishable fire.",
        "Then Jesus came from Galilee to John to be baptized by him in the Jordan River.",
        "But John tried to prevent him, saying,",
        "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?",
        "So Jesus replied to him,",
        "Let it happen now, for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then John yielded to him.",
        "After Jesus was baptized, just as he was coming up out of the water, the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him.",
        "And a voice from heaven said,",
        "This is my one dear Son; in him I take great delight.",
        "Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.",
        "After he fasted forty days and forty nights he was famished.",
        "The tempter came and said to him,",
        "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.",
        "But he answered,",
        "It is written, ‘Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’",
        "Then the devil took him to the holy city, had him stand on the highest point of the temple,",
        "and said to him,",
        "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you’ and ‘with their hands they will lift you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Once again it is written: ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’",
        "Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their grandeur.",
        "And he said to him,",
        "I will give you all these things if you throw yourself to the ground and worship me.",
        "Then Jesus said to him,",
        "Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘You are to worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’",
        "Then the devil left him, and angels came and began ministering to his needs.",
        "Now when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he went into Galilee.",
        "While in Galilee, he moved from Nazareth to make his home in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,",
        "so that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled:",
        "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way by the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles &#8211;",
        "the people who sit in darkness have seen a great light, and on those who sit in the region and shadow of death a light has dawned.",
        "From that time Jesus began to preach this message:",
        "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.",
        "As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon (called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).",
        "He said to them,",
        "Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.",
        "They left their nets immediately and followed him.",
        "Going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. Then he called them.",
        "They immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.",
        "Jesus went throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of disease and sickness among the people.",
        "So a report about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who suffered with various illnesses and afflictions, those who had seizures, paralytics, and those possessed by demons, and he healed them.",
        "And large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan River.",
        "When he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain. After he sat down his disciples came to him.",
        "Then he began to teach them by saying:",
        "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.",
        "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.",
        "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.",
        "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.",
        "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.",
        "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.",
        "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children of God.",
        "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.",
        "Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things about you falsely on account of me.",
        "Rejoice and be glad because your reward is great in heaven, for they persecuted the prophets before you in the same way.",
        "You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled on by people.",
        "You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill cannot be hidden.",
        "People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house.",
        "In the same way, let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good deeds and give honor to your Father in heaven.",
        "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.",
        "I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter will pass from the law until everything takes place.",
        "So anyone who breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever obeys them and teaches others to do so will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.",
        "For I tell you, unless your righteousness goes beyond that of the experts in the law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.",
        "You have heard that it was said to an older generation, ‘Do not murder,’ and ‘whoever murders will be subjected to judgment.’",
        "But I say to you that anyone who is angry with a brother will be subjected to judgment. And whoever insults a brother will be brought before the council, and whoever says ‘Fool’ will be sent to fiery hell.",
        "So then, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,",
        "leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your gift.",
        "Reach agreement quickly with your accuser while on the way to court, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the warden, and you will be thrown into prison.",
        "I tell you the truth, you will never get out of there until you have paid the last penny!",
        "You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’",
        "But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.",
        "If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell.",
        "If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into hell.",
        "It was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a legal document.’",
        "But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.",
        "Again, you have heard that it was said to an older generation, ‘Do not break an oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.’",
        "But I say to you, do not take oaths at all &#8211; not by heaven, because it is the throne of God,",
        "not by earth, because it is his footstool, and not by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.",
        "Do not take an oath by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.",
        "Let your word be ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no.’ More than this is from the evil one.",
        "You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’",
        "But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer. But whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.",
        "And if someone wants to sue you and to take your tunic, give him your coat also.",
        "And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two.",
        "Give to the one who asks you, and do not reject the one who wants to borrow from you.",
        "You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘hate your enemy.’",
        "But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you,",
        "so that you may be like your Father in heaven, since he causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.",
        "For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even the tax collectors do the same, don’t they?",
        "And if you only greet your brothers, what more do you do? Even the Gentiles do the same, don’t they?",
        "So then, be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.",
        "Be careful not to display your righteousness merely to be seen by people. Otherwise you have no reward with your Father in heaven.",
        "Thus whenever you do charitable giving, do not blow a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in synagogues and on streets so that people will praise them. I tell you the truth, they have their reward.",
        "But when you do your giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,",
        "so that your gift may be in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.",
        "Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on street corners so that people can see them. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.",
        "But whenever you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.",
        "When you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the Gentiles, because they think that by their many words they will be heard.",
        "Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.",
        "So pray this way: Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored,",
        "may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.",
        "Give us today our daily bread,",
        "and forgive us our debts, as we ourselves have forgiven our debtors.",
        "And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.",
        "For if you forgive others their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.",
        "But if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive you your sins.",
        "When you fast, do not look sullen like the hypocrites, for they make their faces unattractive so that people will see them fasting. I tell you the truth, they have their reward.",
        "When you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,",
        "so that it will not be obvious to others when you are fasting, but only to your Father who is in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.",
        "Do not accumulate for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.",
        "But accumulate for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.",
        "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.",
        "The eye is the lamp of the body. If then your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.",
        "But if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!",
        "No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.",
        "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Isn’t there more to life than food and more to the body than clothing?",
        "Look at the birds in the sky: They do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you more valuable than they are?",
        "And which of you by worrying can add even one hour to his life?",
        "Why do you worry about clothing? Think about how the flowers of the field grow; they do not work or spin.",
        "Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these!",
        "And if this is how God clothes the wild grass, which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven, won’t he clothe you even more, you people of little faith?",
        "So then, don’t worry saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’",
        "For the unconverted pursue these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.",
        "But above all pursue his kingdom and righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.",
        "So then, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.",
        "Do not judge so that you will not be judged.",
        "For by the standard you judge you will be judged, and the measure you use will be the measure you receive.",
        "Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to see the beam of wood in your own?",
        "Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ while there is a beam in your own?",
        "You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.",
        "Do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs; otherwise they will trample them under their feet and turn around and tear you to pieces.",
        "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you.",
        "For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.",
        "Is there anyone among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?",
        "Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?",
        "If you then, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!",
        "In everything, treat others as you would want them to treat you, for this fulfills the law and the prophets.",
        "Enter through the narrow gate, because the gate is wide and the way is spacious that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.",
        "But the gate is narrow and the way is difficult that leads to life, and there are few who find it.",
        "Watch out for false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are voracious wolves.",
        "You will recognize them by their fruit. Grapes are not gathered from thorns or figs from thistles, are they?",
        "In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.",
        "A good tree is not able to bear bad fruit, nor a bad tree to bear good fruit.",
        "Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.",
        "So then, you will recognize them by their fruit.",
        "Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven &#8211; only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.",
        "On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons and do many powerful deeds?’",
        "Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you. Go away from me, you lawbreakers!’",
        "Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house on rock.",
        "The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, but it did not collapse because it had been founded on rock.",
        "Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.",
        "The rain fell, the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, and it collapsed; it was utterly destroyed!",
        "When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed by his teaching,",
        "because he taught them like one who had authority, not like their experts in the law.",
        "After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.",
        "And a leper approached, and bowed low before him, saying,",
        "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.",
        "He stretched out his hand and touched him saying,",
        "I am willing. Be clean! Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.",
        "Then Jesus said to him,",
        "See that you do not speak to anyone, but go, show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.",
        "When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him asking for help:",
        "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible anguish.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "I will come and heal him.",
        "But the centurion replied,",
        "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. Instead, just say the word and my servant will be healed.",
        "For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go’ and he goes, and to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this’ and he does it.",
        "When Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who followed him,",
        "I tell you the truth, I have not found such faith in anyone in Israel!",
        "I tell you, many will come from the east and west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,",
        "but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
        "Then Jesus said to the centurion,",
        "Go; just as you believed, it will be done for you. And the servant was healed at that hour.",
        "Now when Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, sick with a fever.",
        "He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to serve them.",
        "When it was evening, many demon-possessed people were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.",
        "In this way what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet was fulfilled:",
        "He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases.",
        "Now when Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he gave orders to go to the other side of the lake.",
        "Then an expert in the law came to him and said,",
        "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Foxes have dens, and the birds in the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.",
        "Another of the disciples said to him,",
        "Lord, let me first go and bury my father.",
        "But Jesus said to him,",
        "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.",
        "As he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.",
        "And a great storm developed on the sea so that the waves began to swamp the boat. But he was asleep.",
        "So they came and woke him up saying,",
        "Lord, save us! We are about to die!",
        "But he said to them,",
        "Why are you cowardly, you people of little faith? Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was dead calm.",
        "And the men were amazed and said,",
        "What sort of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!",
        "When he came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were extremely violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.",
        "They cried out,",
        "Son of God, leave us alone! Have you come here to torment us before the time?",
        "A large herd of pigs was feeding some distance from them.",
        "Then the demons begged him,",
        "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.",
        "And he said,",
        "Go! So they came out and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water.",
        "The herdsmen ran off, went into the town, and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men.",
        "Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.",
        "After getting into a boat he crossed to the other side and came to his own town.",
        "Just then some people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic,",
        "Have courage, son! Your sins are forgiven.",
        "Then some of the experts in the law said to themselves,",
        "This man is blaspheming!",
        "When Jesus saw their reaction he said,",
        "Why do you respond with evil in your hearts?",
        "Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?",
        "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins &#8211; then he said to the paralytic &#8211;",
        "Stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.",
        "And he stood up and went home.",
        "When the crowd saw this, they were afraid and honored God who had given such authority to men.",
        "As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth.",
        "Follow me, he said to him. And he got up and followed him.",
        "As Jesus was having a meal in Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.",
        "When the Pharisees saw this they said to his disciples,",
        "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?",
        "When Jesus heard this he said,",
        "Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do.",
        "Go and learn what this saying means: ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.",
        "Then John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked,",
        "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "The wedding guests cannot mourn while the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.",
        "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, because the patch will pull away from the garment and the tear will be worse.",
        "And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the skins burst and the wine is spilled out and the skins are destroyed. Instead they put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved.",
        "As he was saying these things, a ruler came, bowed low before him, and said,",
        "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and she will live.",
        "Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.",
        "But a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.",
        "For she kept saying to herself,",
        "If only I touch his cloak, I will be healed.",
        "But when Jesus turned and saw her he said,",
        "Have courage, daughter! Your faith has made you well. And the woman was healed from that hour.",
        "When Jesus entered the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd,",
        "he said,",
        "Go away, for the girl is not dead but asleep. And they began making fun of him.",
        "But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and gently took her by the hand, and the girl got up.",
        "And the news of this spread throughout that region.",
        "As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting,",
        "Have mercy on us, Son of David!",
        "When he went into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them,",
        "Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to him,",
        "Yes, Lord.",
        "Then he touched their eyes saying,",
        "Let it be done for you according to your faith.",
        "And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly warned them,",
        "See that no one knows about this.",
        "But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that entire region.",
        "As they were going away, a man who could not talk and was demon-possessed was brought to him.",
        "After the demon was cast out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowds were amazed and said,",
        "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!",
        "But the Pharisees said,",
        "By the ruler of demons he casts out demons.",
        "Then Jesus went throughout all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and sickness.",
        "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were bewildered and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.",
        "Then he said to his disciples,",
        "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.",
        "Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.",
        "Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits so they could cast them out and heal every kind of disease and sickness.",
        "Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (called Peter), and Andrew his brother; James son of Zebedee and John his brother;",
        "Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;",
        "Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.",
        "Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them as follows:",
        "Do not go to Gentile regions and do not enter any Samaritan town.",
        "Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.",
        "As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near!’",
        "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.",
        "Do not take gold, silver, or copper in your belts,",
        "no bag for the journey, or an extra tunic, or sandals or staff, for the worker deserves his provisions.",
        "Whenever you enter a town or village, find out who is worthy there and stay with them until you leave.",
        "As you enter the house, give it greetings.",
        "And if the house is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.",
        "And if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or that town.",
        "I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town!",
        "I am sending you out like sheep surrounded by wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.",
        "Beware of people, because they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues.",
        "And you will be brought before governors and kings because of me, as a witness to them and the Gentiles.",
        "Whenever they hand you over for trial, do not worry about how to speak or what to say, for what you should say will be given to you at that time.",
        "For it is not you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.",
        "Brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against parents and have them put to death.",
        "And you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.",
        "Whenever they persecute you in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.",
        "A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a slave greater than his master.",
        "It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the head of the house ‘Beelzebul,’ how much more will they defame the members of his household!",
        "Do not be afraid of them, for nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not be made known.",
        "What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light, and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.",
        "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.",
        "Aren’t two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will.",
        "Even all the hairs on your head are numbered.",
        "So do not be afraid; you are more valuable than many sparrows.",
        "Whoever, then, acknowledges me before people, I will acknowledge before my Father in heaven.",
        "But whoever denies me before people, I will deny him also before my Father in heaven.",
        "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword.",
        "For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,",
        "and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household.",
        "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.",
        "And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.",
        "Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life because of me will find it.",
        "Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.",
        "Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. Whoever receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.",
        "And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple, I tell you the truth, he will never lose his reward.",
        "When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their towns.",
        "Now when John heard in prison about the deeds Christ had done, he sent his disciples to ask a question:",
        "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?",
        "Jesus answered them,",
        "Go tell John what you hear and see:",
        "The blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news proclaimed to them.",
        "Blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.",
        "While they were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John:",
        "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?",
        "What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? Look, those who wear fancy clothes are in the homes of kings!",
        "What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.",
        "This is the one about whom it is written: ‘Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’",
        "I tell you the truth, among those born of women, no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.",
        "From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and forceful people lay hold of it.",
        "For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John appeared.",
        "And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, who is to come.",
        "The one who has ears had better listen!",
        "To what should I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another,",
        "‘We played the flute for you, yet you did not dance; we wailed in mourning, yet you did not weep.’",
        "For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’",
        "The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him, a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.",
        "Then Jesus began to criticize openly the cities in which he had done many of his miracles, because they did not repent.",
        "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.",
        "But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!",
        "And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to Hades! For if the miracles done among you had been done in Sodom, it would have continued to this day.",
        "But I tell you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!",
        "At that time Jesus said,",
        "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to little children.",
        "Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will.",
        "All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him.",
        "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.",
        "Take my yoke on you and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.",
        "For my yoke is easy to bear, and my load is not hard to carry.",
        "At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on a Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pick heads of wheat and eat them.",
        "But when the Pharisees saw this they said to him,",
        "Look, your disciples are doing what is against the law to do on the Sabbath.",
        "He said to them,",
        "Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry &#8211;",
        "how he entered the house of God and they ate the sacred bread, which was against the law for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests?",
        "Or have you not read in the law that the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are not guilty?",
        "I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.",
        "If you had known what this means: ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.",
        "For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.",
        "Then Jesus left that place and entered their synagogue.",
        "A man was there who had a withered hand. And they asked Jesus,",
        "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they could accuse him.",
        "He said to them,",
        "Would not any one of you, if he had one sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath, take hold of it and lift it out?",
        "How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.",
        "Then he said to the man,",
        "Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out and it was restored, as healthy as the other.",
        "But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, as to how they could assassinate him.",
        "Now when Jesus learned of this, he went away from there. Great crowds followed him, and he healed them all.",
        "But he sternly warned them not to make him known.",
        "This fulfilled what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet:",
        "Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I take great delight. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.",
        "He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.",
        "He will not break a bruised reed or extinguish a smoldering wick, until he brings justice to victory.",
        "And in his name the Gentiles will hope.",
        "Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus healed him so that he could speak and see.",
        "All the crowds were amazed and said,",
        "Could this one be the Son of David?",
        "But when the Pharisees heard this they said,",
        "He does not cast out demons except by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons!",
        "Now when Jesus realized what they were thinking, he said to them,",
        "Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and no town or house divided against itself will stand.",
        "So if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?",
        "And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason they will be your judges.",
        "But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has already overtaken you.",
        "How else can someone enter a strong man’s house and steal his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can thoroughly plunder the house.",
        "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.",
        "For this reason I tell you, people will be forgiven for every sin and blasphemy, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.",
        "Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.",
        "Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is known by its fruit.",
        "Offspring of vipers! How are you able to say anything good, since you are evil? For the mouth speaks from what fills the heart.",
        "The good person brings good things out of his good treasury, and the evil person brings evil things out of his evil treasury.",
        "I tell you that on the day of judgment, people will give an account for every worthless word they speak.",
        "For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.",
        "Then some of the experts in the law along with some Pharisees answered him,",
        "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.",
        "But he answered them,",
        "An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.",
        "For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.",
        "The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented when Jonah preached to them &#8211; and now, something greater than Jonah is here!",
        "The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon &#8211; and now, something greater than Solomon is here!",
        "When an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it passes through waterless places looking for rest but does not find it.",
        "Then it says, ‘I will return to the home I left.’ When it returns, it finds the house empty, swept clean, and put in order.",
        "Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so the last state of that person is worse than the first. It will be that way for this evil generation as well!",
        "While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking to speak to him.",
        "Someone told him,",
        "Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you.",
        "To the one who had said this, Jesus replied,",
        "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?",
        "And pointing toward his disciples he said,",
        "Here are my mother and my brothers!",
        "For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.",
        "On that day after Jesus went out of the house, he sat by the lake.",
        "And such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat to sit while the whole crowd stood on the shore.",
        "He told them many things in parables, saying:",
        "Listen! A sower went out to sow.",
        "And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.",
        "Other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil. They sprang up quickly because the soil was not deep.",
        "But when the sun came up, they were scorched, and because they did not have sufficient root, they withered.",
        "Other seeds fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked them.",
        "But other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.",
        "The one who has ears had better listen!",
        "Then the disciples came to him and said,",
        "Why do you speak to them in parables?",
        "He replied,",
        "You have been given the opportunity to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they have not.",
        "For whoever has will be given more, and will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.",
        "For this reason I speak to them in parables: Although they see they do not see, and although they hear they do not hear nor do they understand.",
        "And concerning them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: ‘You will listen carefully yet will never understand, you will look closely yet will never comprehend.",
        "For the heart of this people has become dull; they are hard of hearing, and they have shut their eyes, so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.’",
        "But your eyes are blessed because they see, and your ears because they hear.",
        "For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.",
        "So listen to the parable of the sower:",
        "When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches what was sown in his heart; this is the seed sown along the path.",
        "The seed sown on rocky ground is the person who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.",
        "But he has no root in himself and does not endure; when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away.",
        "The seed sown among thorns is the person who hears the word, but worldly cares and the seductiveness of wealth choke the word, so it produces nothing.",
        "But as for the seed sown on good soil, this is the person who hears the word and understands. He bears fruit, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.",
        "He presented them with another parable:",
        "The kingdom of heaven is like a person who sowed good seed in his field.",
        "But while everyone was sleeping, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.",
        "When the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds also appeared.",
        "So the slaves of the owner came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?’",
        "He said, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the slaves replied, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them?’",
        "But he said, ‘No, since in gathering the weeds you may uproot the wheat with them.",
        "Let both grow together until the harvest. At harvest time I will tell the reapers,",
        "First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, but then gather the wheat into my barn.’",
        "He gave them another parable:",
        "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.",
        "It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest garden plant and becomes a tree, so that the wild birds come and nest in its branches.",
        "He told them another parable:",
        "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen.",
        "Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds; he did not speak to them without a parable.",
        "This fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet:",
        "I will open my mouth in parables, I will announce what has been hidden from the foundation of the world.",
        "Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him saying,",
        "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.",
        "He answered,",
        "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.",
        "The field is the world and the good seed are the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one,",
        "and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.",
        "As the weeds are collected and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of the age.",
        "The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes sin as well as all lawbreakers.",
        "They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
        "Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears had better listen!",
        "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure, hidden in a field, that a person found and hid. Then because of joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.",
        "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.",
        "When he found a pearl of great value, he went out and sold everything he had and bought it.",
        "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea that caught all kinds of fish.",
        "When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and put the good fish into containers and threw the bad away.",
        "It will be this way at the end of the age. Angels will come and separate the evil from the righteous",
        "and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
        "Have you understood all these things? They replied,",
        "Yes.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Therefore every expert in the law who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and old.",
        "Now when Jesus finished these parables, he moved on from there.",
        "Then he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were astonished and said,",
        "Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?",
        "Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary? And aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?",
        "And aren’t all his sisters here with us? Where did he get all this?",
        "And so they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them,",
        "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house.",
        "And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.",
        "At that time Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus,",
        "and he said to his servants,",
        "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead! And because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.",
        "For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,",
        "because John had repeatedly told him,",
        "It is not lawful for you to have her.",
        "Although Herod wanted to kill John, he feared the crowd because they accepted John as a prophet.",
        "But on Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,",
        "so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.",
        "Instructed by her mother, she said,",
        "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.",
        "Although it grieved the king, because of his oath and the dinner guests he commanded it to be given.",
        "So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.",
        "His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.",
        "Then John’s disciples came and took the body and buried it and went and told Jesus.",
        "Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to an isolated place. But when the crowd heard about it, they followed him on foot from the towns.",
        "As he got out he saw the large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.",
        "When evening arrived, his disciples came to him saying,",
        "This is an isolated place and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.",
        "But he replied,",
        "They don’t need to go. You give them something to eat.",
        "They said to him,",
        "We have here only five loaves and two fish.",
        "Bring them here to me, he replied.",
        "Then he instructed the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the crowds.",
        "They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, twelve baskets full.",
        "Not counting women and children, there were about five thousand men who ate.",
        "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dispersed the crowds.",
        "And after he sent the crowds away, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.",
        "Meanwhile the boat, already far from land, was taking a beating from the waves because the wind was against it.",
        "As the night was ending, Jesus came to them walking on the sea.",
        "When the disciples saw him walking on the water they were terrified and said,",
        "It’s a ghost! and cried out with fear.",
        "But immediately Jesus spoke to them:",
        "Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.",
        "Peter said to him,",
        "Lord, if it is you, order me to come to you on the water.",
        "So he said,",
        "Come. Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.",
        "But when he saw the strong wind he became afraid. And starting to sink, he cried out,",
        "Lord, save me!",
        "Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him,",
        "You of little faith, why did you doubt?",
        "When they went up into the boat, the wind ceased.",
        "Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying,",
        "Truly you are the Son of God.",
        "After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.",
        "When the people there recognized him, they sent word into all the surrounding area, and they brought all their sick to him.",
        "They begged him if they could only touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.",
        "Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said,",
        "Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat.",
        "He answered them,",
        "And why do you disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?",
        "For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’",
        "But you say, ‘If someone tells his father or mother,",
        "Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God,",
        "he does not need to honor his father.’ You have nullified the word of God on account of your tradition.",
        "Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said,",
        "‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,",
        "and they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’",
        "Then he called the crowd to him and said,",
        "Listen and understand.",
        "What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person.",
        "Then the disciples came to him and said,",
        "Do you know that when the Pharisees heard this saying they were offended?",
        "And he replied,",
        "Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.",
        "Leave them! They are blind guides. If someone who is blind leads another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.",
        "But Peter said to him,",
        "Explain this parable to us.",
        "Jesus said,",
        "Even after all this, are you still so foolish?",
        "Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and then passes out into the sewer?",
        "But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a person.",
        "For out of the heart come evil ideas, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.",
        "These are the things that defile a person; it is not eating with unwashed hands that defiles a person.",
        "After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.",
        "A Canaanite woman from that area came and cried out,",
        "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed!",
        "But he did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and begged him,",
        "Send her away, because she keeps on crying out after us.",
        "So he answered,",
        "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.",
        "But she came and bowed down before him and said,",
        "Lord, help me!",
        "It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs, he said.",
        "Yes, Lord, she replied,",
        "but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.",
        "Then Jesus answered her,",
        "Woman, your faith is great! Let what you want be done for you. And her daughter was healed from that hour.",
        "When he left there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain, where he sat down.",
        "Then large crowds came to him bringing with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.",
        "As a result, the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.",
        "Then Jesus called the disciples and said,",
        "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way.",
        "The disciples said to him,",
        "Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "How many loaves do you have? They replied,",
        "Seven &#8211; and a few small fish.",
        "After instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground,",
        "he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowds.",
        "They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.",
        "Not counting children and women, there were four thousand men who ate.",
        "After sending away the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.",
        "Now when the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.",
        "He said,",
        "When evening comes you say, ‘It will be fair weather, because the sky is red,’",
        "and in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, because the sky is red and darkening.’ You know how to judge correctly the appearance of the sky, but you cannot evaluate the signs of the times.",
        "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. Then he left them and went away.",
        "When the disciples went to the other side, they forgot to take bread.",
        "Watch out, Jesus said to them,",
        "beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",
        "So they began to discuss this among themselves, saying,",
        "It is because we brought no bread.",
        "When Jesus learned of this, he said,",
        "You who have such little faith! Why are you arguing among yourselves about having no bread?",
        "Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?",
        "Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?",
        "How could you not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!",
        "Then they understood that he had not told them to be on guard against the yeast in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",
        "When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,",
        "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?",
        "They answered,",
        "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.",
        "He said to them,",
        "But who do you say that I am?",
        "Simon Peter answered,",
        "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.",
        "And Jesus answered him,",
        "You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven!",
        "And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.",
        "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.",
        "Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.",
        "From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.",
        "So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him:",
        "God forbid, Lord! This must not happen to you!",
        "But he turned and said to Peter,",
        "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.",
        "Then Jesus said to his disciples,",
        "If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.",
        "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.",
        "For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life?",
        "For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.",
        "I tell you the truth, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.",
        "Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them privately up a high mountain.",
        "And he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.",
        "Then Moses and Elijah also appeared before them, talking with him.",
        "So Peter said to Jesus,",
        "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, I will make three shelters &#8211; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.",
        "While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said,",
        "This is my one dear Son, in whom I take great delight. Listen to him!",
        "When the disciples heard this, they were overwhelmed with fear and threw themselves down with their faces to the ground.",
        "But Jesus came and touched them.",
        "Get up, he said.",
        "Do not be afraid.",
        "When they looked up, all they saw was Jesus alone.",
        "As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them,",
        "Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.",
        "The disciples asked him,",
        "Why then do the experts in the law say that Elijah must come first?",
        "He answered,",
        "Elijah does indeed come first and will restore all things.",
        "And I tell you that Elijah has already come. Yet they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.",
        "Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.",
        "When they came to the crowd, a man came to him, knelt before him,",
        "and said,",
        "Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers terribly, for he often falls into the fire and into the water.",
        "I brought him to your disciples, but they were not able to heal him.",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "You unbelieving and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I endure you? Bring him here to me.",
        "Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed from that moment.",
        "Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said,",
        "Why couldn’t we cast it out?",
        "He told them,",
        "It was because of your little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "When they gathered together in Galilee, Jesus told them,",
        "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.",
        "They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised. And they became greatly distressed.",
        "After they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said,",
        "Your teacher pays the double drachma tax, doesn’t he?",
        "He said,",
        "Yes. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first,",
        "What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly kings collect tolls or taxes &#8211; from their sons or from foreigners?",
        "After he said,",
        "From foreigners, Jesus said to him,",
        "Then the sons are free.",
        "But so that we don’t offend them, go to the lake and throw out a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a four drachma coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.",
        "At that time the disciples came to Jesus saying,",
        "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?",
        "He called a child, had him stand among them,",
        "and said,",
        "I tell you the truth, unless you turn around and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven!",
        "Whoever then humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.",
        "And whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.",
        "But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a huge millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the open sea.",
        "Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! It is necessary that stumbling blocks come, but woe to the person through whom they come.",
        "If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.",
        "And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into fiery hell.",
        "See that you do not disdain one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "What do you think? If someone owns a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go look for the one that went astray?",
        "And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he will rejoice more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.",
        "In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that one of these little ones be lost.",
        "If your brother sins, go and show him his fault when the two of you are alone. If he listens to you, you have regained your brother.",
        "But if he does not listen, take one or two others with you, so that at the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.",
        "If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. If he refuses to listen to the church, treat him like a Gentile or a tax collector.",
        "I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.",
        "Again, I tell you the truth, if two of you on earth agree about whatever you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.",
        "For where two or three are assembled in my name, I am there among them.",
        "Then Peter came to him and said,",
        "Lord, how many times must I forgive my brother who sins against me? As many as seven times?",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Not seven times, I tell you, but seventy-seven times!",
        "For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.",
        "As he began settling his accounts, a man who owed ten thousand talents was brought to him.",
        "Because he was not able to repay it, the lord ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, children, and whatever he possessed, and repayment to be made.",
        "Then the slave threw himself to the ground before him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will repay you everything.’",
        "The lord had compassion on that slave and released him, and forgave him the debt.",
        "After he went out, that same slave found one of his fellow slaves who owed him one hundred silver coins. So he grabbed him by the throat and started to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back what you owe me!’",
        "Then his fellow slave threw himself down and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will repay you.’",
        "But he refused. Instead, he went out and threw him in prison until he repaid the debt.",
        "When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were very upset and went and told their lord everything that had taken place.",
        "Then his lord called the first slave and said to him, ‘Evil slave! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me!",
        "Should you not have shown mercy to your fellow slave, just as I showed it to you?’",
        "And in anger his lord turned him over to the prison guards to torture him until he repaid all he owed.",
        "So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive your brother from your heart.",
        "Now when Jesus finished these sayings, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River.",
        "Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.",
        "Then some Pharisees came to him in order to test him. They asked,",
        "Is it lawful to divorce a wife for any cause?",
        "He answered,",
        "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female,",
        "and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh’?",
        "So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.",
        "They said to him,",
        "Why then did Moses command us to give a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hard hearts, but from the beginning it was not this way.",
        "Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another commits adultery.",
        "The disciples said to him,",
        "If this is the case of a husband with a wife, it is better not to marry!",
        "He said to them,",
        "Not everyone can accept this statement, except those to whom it has been given.",
        "For there are some eunuchs who were that way from birth, and some who were made eunuchs by others, and some who became eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept this should accept it.",
        "Then little children were brought to him for him to lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples scolded those who brought them.",
        "But Jesus said,",
        "Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.",
        "And he placed his hands on them and went on his way.",
        "Now someone came up to him and said,",
        "Teacher, what good thing must I do to gain eternal life?",
        "He said to him,",
        "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.",
        "Which ones? he asked. Jesus replied,",
        "Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,",
        "honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.",
        "The young man said to him,",
        "I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws. What do I still lack?",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "If you wish to be perfect, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.",
        "But when the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.",
        "Then Jesus said to his disciples,",
        "I tell you the truth, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!",
        "Again I say, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.",
        "The disciples were greatly astonished when they heard this and said,",
        "Then who can be saved?",
        "Jesus looked at them and replied,",
        "This is impossible for mere humans, but for God all things are possible.",
        "Then Peter said to him,",
        "Look, we have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "I tell you the truth: In the age when all things are renewed, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
        "And whoever has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.",
        "But many who are first will be last, and the last first.",
        "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.",
        "And after agreeing with the workers for the standard wage, he sent them into his vineyard.",
        "When it was about nine o’clock in the morning, he went out again and saw others standing around in the marketplace without work.",
        "He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and I will give you whatever is right.’",
        "So they went. When he went out again about noon and three o’clock that afternoon, he did the same thing.",
        "And about five o’clock that afternoon he went out and found others standing around, and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here all day without work?’",
        "They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go and work in the vineyard too.’",
        "When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and give the pay starting with the last hired until the first.’",
        "When those hired about five o’clock came, each received a full day’s pay.",
        "And when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more. But each one also received the standard wage.",
        "When they received it, they began to complain against the landowner,",
        "saying, ‘These last fellows worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the hardship and burning heat of the day.’",
        "And the landowner replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me to work for the standard wage?",
        "Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last man the same as I gave to you.",
        "Am I not permitted to do what I want with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?’",
        "So the last will be first, and the first last.",
        "As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside privately and said to them on the way,",
        "Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the experts in the law. They will condemn him to death,",
        "and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged severely and crucified. Yet on the third day, he will be raised.",
        "Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, and kneeling down she asked him for a favor.",
        "He said to her,",
        "What do you want? She replied,",
        "Permit these two sons of mine to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "You don’t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup I am about to drink? They said to him,",
        "We are able.",
        "He told them,",
        "You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right and at my left is not mine to give. Rather, it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.",
        "Now when the other ten heard this, they were angry with the two brothers.",
        "But Jesus called them and said,",
        "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them.",
        "It must not be this way among you! Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,",
        "and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave &#8211;",
        "just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.",
        "As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed them.",
        "Two blind men were sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted,",
        "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!",
        "The crowd scolded them to get them to be quiet. But they shouted even more loudly,",
        "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!",
        "Jesus stopped, called them, and said,",
        "What do you want me to do for you?",
        "They said to him,",
        "Lord, let our eyes be opened.",
        "Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.",
        "Now when they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,",
        "telling them,",
        "Go to the village ahead of you. Right away you will find a donkey tied there, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.",
        "If anyone says anything to you, you are to say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.",
        "This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:",
        "Tell the people of Zion, ‘Look, your king is coming to you, unassuming and seated on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’",
        "So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.",
        "They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them, and he sat on them.",
        "A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.",
        "The crowds that went ahead of him and those following kept shouting,",
        "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!",
        "As he entered Jerusalem the whole city was thrown into an uproar, saying,",
        "Who is this?",
        "And the crowds were saying,",
        "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.",
        "Then Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple courts, and turned over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.",
        "And he said to them,",
        "It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are turning it into a den of robbers!",
        "The blind and lame came to him in the temple courts, and he healed them.",
        "But when the chief priests and the experts in the law saw the wonderful things he did and heard the children crying out in the temple courts,",
        "Hosanna to the Son of David, they became indignant",
        "and said to him,",
        "Do you hear what they are saying? Jesus said to them,",
        "Yes. Have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths of children and nursing infants you have prepared praise for yourself’?",
        "And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.",
        "Now early in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.",
        "After noticing a fig tree by the road he went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it,",
        "Never again will there be fruit from you! And the fig tree withered at once.",
        "When the disciples saw it they were amazed, saying,",
        "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?",
        "Jesus answered them,",
        "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.",
        "And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.",
        "Now after Jesus entered the temple courts, the chief priests and elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching and said,",
        "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?",
        "Jesus answered them,",
        "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.",
        "Where did John’s baptism come from? From heaven or from people? They discussed this among themselves, saying,",
        "If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’",
        "But if we say, ‘From people,’ we fear the crowd, for they all consider John to be a prophet.",
        "So they answered Jesus,",
        "We don’t know. Then he said to them,",
        "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.",
        "What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’",
        "The boy answered, ‘I will not.’ But later he had a change of heart and went.",
        "The father went to the other son and said the same thing. This boy answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but did not go.",
        "Which of the two did his father’s will? They said,",
        "The first. Jesus said to them,",
        "I tell you the truth, tax collectors and prostitutes will go ahead of you into the kingdom of God!",
        "For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe. Although you saw this, you did not later change your minds and believe him.",
        "Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a pit for its winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went on a journey.",
        "When the harvest time was near, he sent his slaves to the tenants to collect his portion of the crop.",
        "But the tenants seized his slaves, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.",
        "Again he sent other slaves, more than the first, and they treated them the same way.",
        "Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’",
        "But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and get his inheritance!’",
        "So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.",
        "Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?",
        "They said to him,",
        "He will utterly destroy those evil men! Then he will lease the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his portion at the harvest.",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "Have you never read in the scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?",
        "For this reason I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.",
        "The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be crushed.",
        "When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them.",
        "They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, because the crowds regarded him as a prophet.",
        "Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:",
        "The kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.",
        "He sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the banquet, but they would not come.",
        "Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited,",
        "Look! The feast I have prepared for you is ready. My oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’",
        "But they were indifferent and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.",
        "The rest seized his slaves, insolently mistreated them, and killed them.",
        "The king was furious! He sent his soldiers, and they put those murderers to death and set their city on fire.",
        "Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but the ones who had been invited were not worthy.",
        "So go into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.’",
        "And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.",
        "But when the king came in to see the wedding guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.",
        "And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But he had nothing to say.",
        "Then the king said to his attendants, ‘Tie him up hand and foot and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’",
        "For many are called, but few are chosen.",
        "Then the Pharisees went out and planned together to entrap him with his own words.",
        "They sent to him their disciples along with the Herodians, saying,",
        "Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not court anyone’s favor because you show no partiality.",
        "Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?",
        "But Jesus realized their evil intentions and said,",
        "Hypocrites! Why are you testing me?",
        "Show me the coin used for the tax. So they brought him a denarius.",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "Whose image is this, and whose inscription?",
        "They replied,",
        "Caesar’s. He said to them,",
        "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.",
        "Now when they heard this they were stunned, and they left him and went away.",
        "The same day Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to him and asked him,",
        "Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and father children for his brother.’",
        "Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children he left his wife to his brother.",
        "The second did the same, and the third, down to the seventh.",
        "Last of all, the woman died.",
        "In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.",
        "Jesus answered them,",
        "You are deceived, because you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God.",
        "For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.",
        "Now as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God,",
        "‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living!",
        "When the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.",
        "Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled together.",
        "And one of them, an expert in religious law, asked him a question to test him:",
        "Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’",
        "This is the first and greatest commandment.",
        "The second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’",
        "All the law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.",
        "While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them a question:",
        "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They said,",
        "The son of David.",
        "He said to them,",
        "How then does David by the Spirit call him ‘Lord,’ saying,",
        "‘The Lord said to my lord,",
        "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet’?",
        "If David then calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?",
        "No one was able to answer him a word, and from that day on no one dared to question him any longer.",
        "Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,",
        "The experts in the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat.",
        "Therefore pay attention to what they tell you and do it. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they teach.",
        "They tie up heavy loads, hard to carry, and put them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing even to lift a finger to move them.",
        "They do all their deeds to be seen by people, for they make their phylacteries wide and their tassels long.",
        "They love the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues",
        "and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces, and to have people call them ‘Rabbi.’",
        "But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers.",
        "And call no one your ‘father’ on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.",
        "Nor are you to be called ‘teacher,’ for you have one teacher, the Christ.",
        "The greatest among you will be your servant.",
        "And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.",
        "But woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You keep locking people out of the kingdom of heaven! For you neither enter nor permit those trying to enter to go in.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You cross land and sea to make one convert, and when you get one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!",
        "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by the oath.’",
        "Blind fools! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred?",
        "And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift on it he is bound by the oath.’",
        "You are blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?",
        "So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.",
        "And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and the one who dwells in it.",
        "And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and the one who sits on it.",
        "Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You give a tenth of mint, dill, and cumin, yet you neglect what is more important in the law &#8211; justice, mercy, and faithfulness! You should have done these things without neglecting the others.",
        "Blind guides! You strain out a gnat yet swallow a camel!",
        "Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.",
        "Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside may become clean too!",
        "Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of the bones of the dead and of everything unclean.",
        "In the same way, on the outside you look righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.",
        "Woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.",
        "And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’",
        "By saying this you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.",
        "Fill up then the measure of your ancestors!",
        "You snakes, you offspring of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?",
        "For this reason I am sending you prophets and wise men and experts in the law, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town,",
        "so that on you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.",
        "I tell you the truth, this generation will be held responsible for all these things!",
        "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would have none of it!",
        "Look, your house is left to you desolate!",
        "For I tell you, you will not see me from now until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’",
        "Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts and walking away, his disciples came to show him the temple buildings.",
        "And he said to them,",
        "Do you see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left on another. All will be torn down!",
        "As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said,",
        "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?",
        "Jesus answered them,",
        "Watch out that no one misleads you.",
        "For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will mislead many.",
        "You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Make sure that you are not alarmed, for this must happen, but the end is still to come.",
        "For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.",
        "All these things are the beginning of birth pains.",
        "Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you. You will be hated by all the nations because of my name.",
        "Then many will be led into sin, and they will betray one another and hate one another.",
        "And many false prophets will appear and deceive many,",
        "and because lawlessness will increase so much, the love of many will grow cold.",
        "But the person who endures to the end will be saved.",
        "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole inhabited earth as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.",
        "So when you see the abomination of desolation &#8211; spoken about by Daniel the prophet &#8211; standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),",
        "then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.",
        "The one on the roof must not come down to take anything out of his house,",
        "and the one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.",
        "Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!",
        "Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath.",
        "For then there will be great suffering unlike anything that has happened from the beginning of the world until now, or ever will happen.",
        "And if those days had not been cut short, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.",
        "Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe him.",
        "For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.",
        "Remember, I have told you ahead of time.",
        "So then, if someone says to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe him.",

        "Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.",
        "Immediately after the suffering of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken.",
        "Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.",
        "And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet blast, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.",
        "Learn this parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.",
        "So also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near, right at the door.",
        "I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.",
        "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.",
        "But as for that day and hour no one knows it &#8211; not even the angels in heaven &#8211; except the Father alone.",
        "For just like the days of Noah were, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.",
        "For in those days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark.",
        "And they knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away. It will be the same at the coming of the Son of Man.",
        "Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left.",
        "There will be two women grinding grain with a mill; one will be taken and one left.",
        "Therefore stay alert, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.",
        "But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have been alert and would not have let his house be broken into.",
        "Therefore you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.",
        "Who then is the faithful and wise slave, whom the master has put in charge of his household, to give the other slaves their food at the proper time?",
        "Blessed is that slave whom the master finds at work when he comes.",
        "I tell you the truth, the master will put him in charge of all his possessions.",
        "But if that evil slave should say to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time,’",
        "and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and to eat and drink with drunkards,",
        "then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee,",
        "and will cut him in two, and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
        "At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.",
        "Five of the virgins were foolish, and five were wise.",
        "When the foolish ones took their lamps, they did not take extra olive oil with them.",
        "But the wise ones took flasks of olive oil with their lamps.",
        "When the bridegroom was delayed a long time, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.",
        "But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Look, the bridegroom is here! Come out to meet him.’",
        "Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.",
        "The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.’",
        "‘No,’ they replied. ‘There won’t be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’",
        "But while they had gone to buy it, the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding banquet. Then the door was shut.",
        "Later, the other virgins came too, saying, ‘Lord, lord! Let us in!’",
        "But he replied, ‘I tell you the truth, I do not know you!’",
        "Therefore stay alert, because you do not know the day or the hour.",
        "For it is like a man going on a journey, who summoned his slaves and entrusted his property to them.",
        "To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.",
        "The one who had received five talents went off right away and put his money to work and gained five more.",
        "In the same way, the one who had two gained two more.",
        "But the one who had received one talent went out and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money in it.",
        "After a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled his accounts with them.",
        "The one who had received the five talents came and brought five more, saying, ‘Sir, you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’",
        "His master answered, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful in a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’",
        "The one with the two talents also came and said, ‘Sir, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more.’",
        "His master answered, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful with a few things. I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’",
        "Then the one who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Sir, I knew that you were a hard man, harvesting where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed,",
        "so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.’",
        "But his master answered, ‘Evil and lazy slave! So you knew that I harvest where I didn’t sow and gather where I didn’t scatter?",
        "Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received my money back with interest!",
        "Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten.",
        "For the one who has will be given more, and he will have more than enough. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.",
        "And throw that worthless slave into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’",
        "When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.",
        "All the nations will be assembled before him, and he will separate people one from another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.",
        "He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.",
        "Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.",
        "For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,",
        "I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.’",
        "Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?",
        "When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or naked and clothe you?",
        "When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’",
        "And the king will answer them, ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of mine, you did it for me.’",
        "Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels!",
        "For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.",
        "I was a stranger and you did not receive me as a guest, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’",
        "Then they too will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not give you whatever you needed?’",
        "Then he will answer them, ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for me.’",
        "And these will depart into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.",
        "When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples,",
        "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.",
        "Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.",
        "They planned to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.",
        "But they said,",
        "Not during the feast, so that there won’t be a riot among the people.",
        "Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper,",
        "a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfumed oil, and she poured it on his head as he was at the table.",
        "When the disciples saw this, they became indignant and said,",
        "Why this waste?",
        "It could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor!",
        "When Jesus learned of this, he said to them,",
        "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good service for me.",
        "For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!",
        "When she poured this oil on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.",
        "I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.",
        "Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests",
        "and said,",
        "What will you give me to betray him into your hands? So they set out thirty silver coins for him.",
        "From that time on, Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray him.",
        "Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and said,",
        "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?",
        "He said,",
        "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says,",
        "My time is near. I will observe the Passover with my disciples at your house.’",
        "So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover.",
        "When it was evening, he took his place at the table with the twelve.",
        "And while they were eating he said,",
        "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.",
        "They became greatly distressed and each one began to say to him,",
        "Surely not I, Lord?",
        "He answered,",
        "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.",
        "The Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born.",
        "Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said,",
        "Surely not I, Rabbi? Jesus replied,",
        "You have said it yourself.",
        "While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to his disciples, and said,",
        "Take, eat, this is my body.",
        "And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying,",
        "Drink from it, all of you,",
        "for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.",
        "I tell you, from now on I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.",
        "After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "This night you will all fall away because of me, for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’",
        "But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.",
        "Peter said to him,",
        "If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "I tell you the truth, on this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.",
        "Peter said to him,",
        "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you. And all the disciples said the same thing.",
        "Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples,",
        "Sit here while I go over there and pray.",
        "He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became anguished and distressed.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.",
        "Going a little farther, he threw himself down with his face to the ground and prayed,",
        "My Father, if possible, let this cup pass from me! Yet not what I will, but what you will.",
        "Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter,",
        "So, couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour?",
        "Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.",
        "He went away a second time and prayed,",
        "My Father, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will must be done.",
        "He came again and found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open.",
        "So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing once more.",
        "Then he came to the disciples and said to them,",
        "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is approaching, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
        "Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer is approaching!",
        "While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.",
        "(Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying,",
        "The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him!)",
        "Immediately he went up to Jesus and said,",
        "Greetings, Rabbi, and kissed him.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Friend, do what you are here to do. Then they came and took hold of Jesus and arrested him.",
        "But one of those with Jesus grabbed his sword, drew it out, and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear.",
        "Then Jesus said to him,",
        "Put your sword back in its place! For all who take hold of the sword will die by the sword.",
        "Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and that he would send me more than twelve legions of angels right now?",
        "How then would the scriptures that say it must happen this way be fulfilled?",
        "At that moment Jesus said to the crowd,",
        "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts, yet you did not arrest me.",
        "But this has happened so that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.",
        "Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house the experts in the law and the elders had gathered.",
        "But Peter was following him from a distance, all the way to the high priest’s courtyard. After going in, he sat with the guards to see the outcome.",
        "The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death.",
        "But they did not find anything, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward",
        "and declared,",
        "This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’",
        "So the high priest stood up and said to him,",
        "Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?",
        "But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him,",
        "I charge you under oath by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.",
        "Then the high priest tore his clothes and declared,",
        "He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Now you have heard the blasphemy!",
        "What is your verdict? They answered,",
        "He is guilty and deserves death.",
        "Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. And some slapped him,",
        "saying,",
        "Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who hit you?",
        "Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A slave girl came to him and said,",
        "You also were with Jesus the Galilean.",
        "But he denied it in front of them all:",
        "I don’t know what you’re talking about!",
        "When he went out to the gateway, another slave girl saw him and said to the people there,",
        "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.",
        "He denied it again with an oath,",
        "I do not know the man!",
        "After a little while, those standing there came up to Peter and said,",
        "You really are one of them too &#8211; even your accent gives you away!",
        "At that he began to curse, and he swore with an oath,",
        "I do not know the man! At that moment a rooster crowed.",
        "Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said:",
        "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. And he went outside and wept bitterly.",
        "When it was early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to execute him.",
        "They tied him up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.",
        "Now when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders,",
        "saying,",
        "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood! But they said,",
        "What is that to us? You take care of it yourself!",
        "So Judas threw the silver coins into the temple and left. Then he went out and hanged himself.",
        "The chief priests took the silver and said,",
        "It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.",
        "After consulting together they bought the Potter’s Field with it, as a burial place for foreigners.",
        "For this reason that field has been called the",
        "Field of Blood to this day.",
        "Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:",
        "They took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one whose price had been set by the people of Israel,",
        "and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.",
        "Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him,",
        "Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus said,",
        "You say so.",
        "But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond.",
        "Then Pilate said to him,",
        "Don’t you hear how many charges they are bringing against you?",
        "But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed.",
        "During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted.",
        "At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.",
        "So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them,",
        "Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?",
        "(For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.)",
        "As he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him:",
        "Have nothing to do with that innocent man; I have suffered greatly as a result of a dream about him today.",
        "But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.",
        "The governor asked them,",
        "Which of the two do you want me to release for you? And they said,",
        "Barabbas!",
        "Pilate said to them,",
        "Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ? They all said,",
        "Crucify him!",
        "He asked,",
        "Why? What wrong has he done? But they shouted more insistently,",
        "Crucify him!",
        "When Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but that instead a riot was starting, he took some water, washed his hands before the crowd and said,",
        "I am innocent of this man’s blood. You take care of it yourselves!",
        "In reply all the people said,",
        "Let his blood be on us and on our children!",
        "Then he released Barabbas for them. But after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.",
        "Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort around him.",
        "They stripped him and put a scarlet robe around him,",
        "and after braiding a crown of thorns, they put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand, and kneeling down before him, they mocked him:",
        "Hail, king of the Jews!",
        "They spat on him and took the staff and struck him repeatedly on the head.",
        "When they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.",
        "As they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry his cross.",
        "They came to a place called Golgotha (which means",
        "Place of the Skull)",
        "and offered Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink. But after tasting it, he would not drink it.",
        "When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice.",
        "Then they sat down and kept guard over him there.",
        "Above his head they put the charge against him, which read:",
        "This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.",
        "Then two outlaws were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.",
        "Those who passed by defamed him, shaking their heads",
        "and saying,",
        "You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!",
        "In the same way even the chief priests &#8211; together with the experts in the law and elders &#8211; were mocking him:",
        "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of Israel! If he comes down now from the cross, we will believe in him!",
        "He trusts in God &#8211; let God, if he wants to, deliver him now because he said, ‘I am God’s Son’!",
        "The robbers who were crucified with him also spoke abusively to him.",
        "Now from noon until three, darkness came over all the land.",
        "At about three o’clock Jesus shouted with a loud voice,",
        "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? that is,",
        "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?",
        "When some of the bystanders heard it, they said,",
        "This man is calling for Elijah.",
        "Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink.",
        "But the rest said,",
        "Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him.",
        "Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.",
        "Just then the temple curtain was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks were split apart.",
        "And tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised.",
        "(They came out of the tombs after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.)",
        "Now when the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what took place, they were extremely terrified and said,",
        "Truly this one was God’s Son!",
        "Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and given him support were also there, watching from a distance.",
        "Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.",
        "Now when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.",
        "He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him.",
        "Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,",
        "and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance of the tomb and went away.",
        "(Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there, opposite the tomb.)",
        "The next day (which is after the day of preparation) the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate",
        "and said,",
        "Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’",
        "So give orders to secure the tomb until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal his body and say to the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.",
        "Pilate said to them,",
        "Take a guard of soldiers. Go and make it as secure as you can.",
        "So they went with the soldiers of the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.",
        "Now after the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.",
        "Suddenly there was a severe earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven came and rolled away the stone and sat on it.",
        "His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.",
        "The guards were shaken and became like dead men because they were so afraid of him.",
        "But the angel said to the women,",
        "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.",
        "He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying.",
        "Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Listen, I have told you!",
        "So they left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.",
        "But Jesus met them, saying,",
        "Greetings! They came to him, held on to his feet and worshiped him.",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.",
        "While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.",
        "After they had assembled with the elders and formed a plan, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,",
        "telling them,",
        "You are to say, ‘His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were asleep.’",
        "If this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.",
        "So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story is told among the Jews to this day.",
        "So the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain Jesus had designated.",
        "When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.",
        "Then Jesus came up and said to them,",
        "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.",
        "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,",
        "teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.",
        "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.",
        "As it is written in Isaiah the prophet,",
        "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way,",
        "the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight.’",
        "In the wilderness John the baptizer began preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
        "People from the whole Judean countryside and all of Jerusalem were going out to him, and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.",
        "John wore a garment made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.",
        "He proclaimed,",
        "One more powerful than I am is coming after me; I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals.",
        "I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.",
        "Now in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.",
        "And just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.",
        "And a voice came from heaven:",
        "You are my one dear Son; in you I take great delight.",
        "The Spirit immediately drove him into the wilderness.",
        "He was in the wilderness forty days, enduring temptations from Satan. He was with wild animals, and angels were ministering to his needs.",
        "Now after John was imprisoned, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.",
        "He said,",
        "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the gospel!",
        "As he went along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.",
        "They left their nets immediately and followed him.",
        "Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother in their boat mending nets.",
        "Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.",
        "Then they went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.",
        "The people there were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them like one who had authority, not like the experts in the law.",
        "Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,",
        "Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are &#8211; the Holy One of God!",
        "But Jesus rebuked him:",
        "Silence! Come out of him!",
        "After throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him.",
        "They were all amazed so that they asked each other,",
        "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.",
        "So the news about him spread quickly throughout all the region around Galilee.",
        "Now as soon as they left the synagogue, they entered Simon and Andrew’s house, with James and John.",
        "Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever, so they spoke to Jesus at once about her.",
        "He came and raised her up by gently taking her hand. Then the fever left her and she began to serve them.",
        "When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed.",
        "The whole town gathered by the door.",
        "So he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.",
        "Then Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark, departed, and went out to a deserted place, and there he spent time in prayer.",
        "Simon and his companions searched for him.",
        "When they found him, they said,",
        "Everyone is looking for you.",
        "He replied,",
        "Let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding villages, so that I can preach there too. For that is what I came out here to do.",
        "So he went into all of Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.",
        "Now a leper came to him and fell to his knees, asking for help.",
        "If you are willing, you can make me clean, he said.",
        "Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying,",
        "I am willing. Be clean!",
        "The leprosy left him at once, and he was clean.",
        "Immediately Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning.",
        "He told him,",
        "See that you do not say anything to anyone, but go, show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.",
        "But as the man went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter any town openly but stayed outside in remote places. Still they kept coming to him from everywhere.",
        "Now after some days, when he returned to Capernaum, the news spread that he was at home.",
        "So many gathered that there was no longer any room, not even by the door, and he preached the word to them.",
        "Some people came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.",
        "When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Jesus. Then, after tearing it out, they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on.",
        "When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic,",
        "Son, your sins are forgiven.",
        "Now some of the experts in the law were sitting there, turning these things over in their minds:",
        "Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?",
        "Now immediately, when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts, he said to them,",
        "Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?",
        "Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up, take your stretcher, and walk’?",
        "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, &#8211; he said to the paralytic &#8211;",
        "I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.",
        "And immediately the man stood up, took his stretcher, and went out in front of them all. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying,",
        "We have never seen anything like this!",
        "Jesus went out again by the sea. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them.",
        "As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth.",
        "Follow me, he said to him. And he got up and followed him.",
        "As Jesus was having a meal in Levi’s home, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.",
        "When the experts in the law and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples,",
        "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?",
        "When Jesus heard this he said to them,",
        "Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.",
        "Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and said,",
        "Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they do not fast.",
        "But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and at that time they will fast.",
        "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse.",
        "And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. Instead new wine is poured into new wineskins.",
        "Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat as they made their way.",
        "So the Pharisees said to him,",
        "Look, why are they doing what is against the law on the Sabbath?",
        "He said to them,",
        "Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry &#8211;",
        "how he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the sacred bread, which is against the law for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to his companions?",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.",
        "For this reason the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.",
        "Then Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.",
        "They watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they could accuse him.",
        "So he said to the man who had the withered hand,",
        "Stand up among all these people.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or evil, to save a life or destroy it? But they were silent.",
        "After looking around at them in anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man,",
        "Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.",
        "So the Pharisees went out immediately and began plotting with the Herodians, as to how they could assassinate him.",
        "Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him. And from Judea,",
        "Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and around Tyre and Sidon a great multitude came to him when they heard about the things he had done.",
        "Because of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so the crowd would not press toward him.",
        "For he had healed many, so that all who were afflicted with diseases pressed toward him in order to touch him.",
        "And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out,",
        "You are the Son of God.",
        "But he sternly ordered them not to make him known.",
        "Now Jesus went up the mountain and called for those he wanted, and they came to him.",
        "He appointed twelve (whom he named apostles), so that they would be with him and he could send them to preach",
        "and to have authority to cast out demons.",
        "He appointed twelve: To Simon he gave the name Peter;",
        "to James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee, he gave the name Boanerges (that is,",
        "sons of thunder);",
        "and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,",
        "and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.",
        "Now Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered so that they were not able to eat.",
        "When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said,",
        "He is out of his mind.",
        "The experts in the law who came down from Jerusalem said,",
        "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and,",
        "By the ruler of demons he casts out demons.",
        "So he called them and spoke to them in parables:",
        "How can Satan cast out Satan?",
        "If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom will not be able to stand.",
        "If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.",
        "And if Satan rises against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand and his end has come.",
        "But no one is able to enter a strong man’s house and steal his property unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can thoroughly plunder his house.",
        "I tell you the truth, people will be forgiven for all sins, even all the blasphemies they utter.",
        "But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin",
        "(because they said,",
        "He has an unclean spirit).",
        "Then Jesus’ mother and his brothers came. Standing outside, they sent word to him, to summon him.",
        "A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him,",
        "Look, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.",
        "He answered them and said,",
        "Who are my mother and my brothers?",
        "And looking at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said,",
        "Here are my mother and my brothers!",
        "For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.",
        "Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake.",
        "He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them:",
        "Listen! A sower went out to sow.",
        "And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.",
        "Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep.",
        "When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root, it withered.",
        "Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.",
        "But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain, sprouting and growing; some yielded thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.",
        "And he said,",
        "Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!",
        "When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.",
        "He said to them,",
        "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables,",
        "so that although they look they may look but not see, and although they hear they may hear but not understand, so they may not repent and be forgiven.",
        "He said to them,",
        "Don’t you understand this parable? Then how will you understand any parable?",
        "The sower sows the word.",
        "These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them.",
        "These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy.",
        "But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.",
        "Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word,",
        "but worldly cares, the seductiveness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it produces nothing.",
        "But these are the ones sown on good soil: They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirty times as much, one sixty, and one a hundred.",
        "He also said to them,",
        "A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand?",
        "For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, and nothing concealed except to be brought to light.",
        "If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!",
        "And he said to them,",
        "Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive, and more will be added to you.",
        "For whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.",
        "He also said,",
        "The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground.",
        "He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.",
        "By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.",
        "And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.",
        "He also asked,",
        "To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it?",
        "It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground, even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground &#8211;",
        "when it is sown, it grows up, becomes the greatest of all garden plants, and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade.",
        "So with many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.",
        "He did not speak to them without a parable. But privately he explained everything to his own disciples.",
        "On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to his disciples,",
        "Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.",
        "So after leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat, and other boats were with him.",
        "Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was nearly swamped.",
        "But he was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him up and said to him,",
        "Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?",
        "So he got up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,",
        "Be quiet! Calm down! Then the wind stopped, and it was dead calm.",
        "And he said to them,",
        "Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?",
        "They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another,",
        "Who then is this? Even the wind and sea obey him!",
        "So they came to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes.",
        "Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs and met him.",
        "He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain.",
        "For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles, but he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one was strong enough to subdue him.",
        "Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones.",
        "When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him.",
        "Then he cried out with a loud voice,",
        "Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I implore you by God &#8211; do not torment me!",
        "(For Jesus had said to him,",
        "Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!)",
        "Jesus asked him,",
        "What is your name? And he said,",
        "My name is Legion, for we are many.",
        "He begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of the region.",
        "There on the hillside, a great herd of pigs was feeding.",
        "And the demonic spirits begged him,",
        "Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them.",
        "Jesus gave them permission. So the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake, and about two thousand were drowned in the lake.",
        "Now the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.",
        "They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind &#8211; the one who had the",
        "Legion &#8211; and they were afraid.",
        "Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs.",
        "Then they asked Jesus to leave their region.",
        "As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him.",
        "But Jesus did not permit him to do so. Instead, he said to him,",
        "Go to your home and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you, that he had mercy on you.",
        "So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him, and all were amazed.",
        "When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea.",
        "Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came up, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.",
        "He asked him urgently,",
        "My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.",
        "Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him.",
        "Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years.",
        "She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.",
        "When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,",
        "for she kept saying,",
        "If only I touch his clothes, I will be healed.",
        "At once the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.",
        "Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said,",
        "Who touched my clothes?",
        "His disciples said to him,",
        "You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, ‘Who touched me?’",
        "But he looked around to see who had done it.",
        "Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.",
        "He said to her,",
        "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.",
        "While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying,",
        "Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?",
        "But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue ruler,",
        "Do not be afraid; just believe.",
        "He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.",
        "They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly.",
        "When he entered he said to them,",
        "Why are you distressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.",
        "And they began making fun of him. But he put them all outside and he took the child’s father and mother and his own companions and went into the room where the child was.",
        "Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her,",
        "Talitha koum, which means,",
        "Little girl, I say to you, get up.",
        "The girl got up at once and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished at this.",
        "He strictly ordered that no one should know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.",
        "Now Jesus left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.",
        "When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard him were astonished, saying,",
        "Where did he get these ideas? And what is this wisdom that has been given to him? What are these miracles that are done through his hands?",
        "Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us? And so they took offense at him.",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own house.",
        "He was not able to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.",
        "And he was amazed because of their unbelief. Then he went around among the villages and taught.",
        "Jesus called the twelve and began to send them out two by two. He gave them authority over the unclean spirits.",
        "He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff &#8211; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts &#8211;",
        "and to put on sandals but not to wear two tunics.",
        "He said to them,",
        "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the area.",
        "If a place will not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.",
        "So they went out and preached that all should repent.",
        "They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.",
        "Now King Herod heard this, for Jesus’ name had become known. Some were saying,",
        "John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.",
        "Others said,",
        "He is Elijah. Others said,",
        "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets from the past.",
        "But when Herod heard this, he said,",
        "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!",
        "For Herod himself had sent men, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her.",
        "For John had repeatedly told Herod,",
        "It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.",
        "So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not",
        "because Herod stood in awe of John and protected him, since he knew that John was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him, he was thoroughly baffled, and yet he liked to listen to John.",
        "But a suitable day came, when Herod gave a banquet on his birthday for his court officials, military commanders, and leaders of Galilee.",
        "When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl,",
        "Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.",
        "He swore to her,",
        "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.",
        "So she went out and said to her mother,",
        "What should I ask for? Her mother said,",
        "The head of John the baptizer.",
        "Immediately she hurried back to the king and made her request:",
        "I want the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.",
        "Although it grieved the king deeply, he did not want to reject her request because of his oath and his guests.",
        "So the king sent an executioner at once to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison.",
        "He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.",
        "When John’s disciples heard this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.",
        "Then the apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.",
        "He said to them,",
        "Come with me privately to an isolated place and rest a while (for many were coming and going, and there was no time to eat).",
        "So they went away by themselves in a boat to some remote place.",
        "But many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they hurried on foot from all the towns and arrived there ahead of them.",
        "As Jesus came ashore he saw the large crowd and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he taught them many things.",
        "When it was already late, his disciples came to him and said,",
        "This is an isolated place and it is already very late.",
        "Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something for themselves to eat.",
        "But he answered them,",
        "You give them something to eat. And they said,",
        "Should we go and buy bread for two hundred silver coins and give it to them to eat?",
        "He said to them,",
        "How many loaves do you have? Go and see. When they found out, they said,",
        "Five &#8211; and two fish.",
        "Then he directed them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.",
        "So they reclined in groups of hundreds and fifties.",
        "He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to his disciples to serve the people, and he divided the two fish among them all.",
        "They all ate and were satisfied,",
        "and they picked up the broken pieces and fish that were left over, twelve baskets full.",
        "Now there were five thousand men who ate the bread.",
        "Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dispersed the crowd.",
        "After saying good-bye to them, he went to the mountain to pray.",
        "When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land.",
        "He saw them straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. As the night was ending, he came to them walking on the sea, for he wanted to pass by them.",
        "When they saw him walking on the water they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,",
        "for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them:",
        "Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.",
        "Then he went up with them into the boat, and the wind ceased. They were completely astonished,",
        "because they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.",
        "After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.",
        "As they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Jesus.",
        "They ran through that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever he was rumored to be.",
        "And wherever he would go &#8211; into villages, towns, or countryside &#8211; they would place the sick in the marketplaces, and would ask him if they could just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.",
        "Now the Pharisees and some of the experts in the law who came from Jerusalem gathered around him.",
        "And they saw that some of Jesus’ disciples ate their bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed.",
        "(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing, holding fast to the tradition of the elders.",
        "And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. They hold fast to many other traditions: the washing of cups, pots, kettles, and dining couches.)",
        "The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him,",
        "Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with unwashed hands?",
        "He said to them,",
        "Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.",
        "They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrine the commandments of men.’",
        "Having no regard for the command of God, you hold fast to human tradition.",
        "He also said to them,",
        "You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up your tradition.",
        "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’",
        "But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother, ‘Whatever help you would have received from me is corban’ (that is, a gift for God),",
        "then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother.",
        "Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this.",
        "Then he called the crowd again and said to them,",
        "Listen to me, everyone, and understand.",
        "There is nothing outside of a person that can defile him by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles him.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable.",
        "He said to them,",
        "Are you so foolish? Don’t you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him?",
        "For it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the sewer. (This means all foods are clean.)",
        "He said,",
        "What comes out of a person defiles him.",
        "For from within, out of the human heart, come evil ideas, sexual immorality, theft, murder,",
        "adultery, greed, evil, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, pride, and folly.",
        "All these evils come from within and defile a person.",
        "After Jesus left there, he went to the region of Tyre. When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know, but he was not able to escape notice.",
        "Instead, a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell at his feet.",
        "The woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician origin. She asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter.",
        "He said to her,",
        "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and to throw it to the dogs.",
        "She answered,",
        "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.",
        "Then he said to her,",
        "Because you said this, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.",
        "She went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.",
        "Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis.",
        "They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they asked him to place his hands on him.",
        "After Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, he put his fingers in the man’s ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.",
        "Then he looked up to heaven and said with a sigh,",
        "Ephphatha (that is,",
        "Be opened).",
        "And immediately the man’s ears were opened, his tongue loosened, and he spoke plainly.",
        "Jesus ordered them not to tell anything. But as much as he ordered them not to do this, they proclaimed it all the more.",
        "People were completely astounded and said,",
        "He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.",
        "In those days there was another large crowd with nothing to eat. So Jesus called his disciples and said to them,",
        "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days, and they have nothing to eat.",
        "If I send them home hungry, they will faint on the way, and some of them have come from a great distance.",
        "His disciples answered him,",
        "Where can someone get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy these people?",
        "He asked them,",
        "How many loaves do you have? They replied,",
        "Seven.",
        "Then he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. After he took the seven loaves and gave thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples to serve. So they served the crowd.",
        "They also had a few small fish. After giving thanks for these, he told them to serve these as well.",
        "Everyone ate and was satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.",
        "There were about four thousand who ate. Then he dismissed them.",
        "Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.",
        "Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, asking for a sign from heaven to test him.",
        "Sighing deeply in his spirit he said,",
        "Why does this generation look for a sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to this generation.",
        "Then he left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.",
        "Now they had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.",
        "And Jesus ordered them,",
        "Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!",
        "So they began to discuss with one another about having no bread.",
        "When he learned of this, Jesus said to them,",
        "Why are you arguing about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Have your hearts been hardened?",
        "Though you have eyes, don’t you see? And though you have ears, can’t you hear? Don’t you remember?",
        "When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up? They replied,",
        "Twelve.",
        "When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up? They replied,",
        "Seven.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Do you still not understand?",
        "Then they came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to Jesus and asked him to touch him.",
        "He took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside of the village. Then he spit on his eyes, placed his hands on his eyes and asked,",
        "Do you see anything?",
        "Regaining his sight he said,",
        "I see people, but they look like trees walking.",
        "Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again. And he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.",
        "Jesus sent him home, saying,",
        "Do not even go into the village.",
        "Then Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples,",
        "Who do people say that I am?",
        "They said,",
        "John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others, one of the prophets.",
        "He asked them,",
        "But who do you say that I am? Peter answered him,",
        "You are the Christ.",
        "Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him.",
        "Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and after three days rise again.",
        "He spoke openly about this. So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.",
        "But after turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said,",
        "Get behind me, Satan. You are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.",
        "Then Jesus called the crowd, along with his disciples, and said to them,",
        "If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.",
        "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it.",
        "For what benefit is it for a person to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his life?",
        "What can a person give in exchange for his life?",
        "For if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.",
        "And he said to them,",
        "I tell you the truth, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.",
        "Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John and led them alone up a high mountain privately. And he was transfigured before them,",
        "and his clothes became radiantly white, more so than any launderer in the world could bleach them.",
        "Then Elijah appeared before them along with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.",
        "So Peter said to Jesus,",
        "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters &#8211; one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.",
        "(For they were afraid, and he did not know what to say.)",
        "Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud,",
        "This is my one dear Son. Listen to him!",
        "Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more except Jesus.",
        "As they were coming down from the mountain, he gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.",
        "They kept this statement to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead meant.",
        "Then they asked him,",
        "Why do the experts in the law say that Elijah must come first?",
        "He said to them,",
        "Elijah does indeed come first, and restores all things. And why is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be despised?",
        "But I tell you that Elijah has certainly come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.",
        "When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and experts in the law arguing with them.",
        "When the whole crowd saw him, they were amazed and ran at once and greeted him.",
        "He asked them,",
        "What are you arguing about with them?",
        "A member of the crowd said to him,",
        "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that makes him mute.",
        "Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they were not able to do so.",
        "He answered them,",
        "You unbelieving generation! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I endure you? Bring him to me.",
        "So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell on the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.",
        "Jesus asked his father,",
        "How long has this been happening to him? And he said,",
        "From childhood.",
        "It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us.",
        "Then Jesus said to him,",
        "‘If you are able?’ All things are possible for the one who believes.",
        "Immediately the father of the boy cried out and said,",
        "I believe; help my unbelief!",
        "Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it,",
        "Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.",
        "It shrieked, threw him into terrible convulsions, and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said,",
        "He is dead!",
        "But Jesus gently took his hand and raised him to his feet, and he stood up.",
        "Then, after he went into the house, his disciples asked him privately,",
        "Why couldn’t we cast it out?",
        "He told them,",
        "This kind can come out only by prayer.",
        "They went out from there and passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know,",
        "for he was teaching his disciples and telling them,",
        "The Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.",
        "But they did not understand this statement and were afraid to ask him.",
        "Then they came to Capernaum. After Jesus was inside the house he asked them,",
        "What were you discussing on the way?",
        "But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.",
        "After he sat down, he called the twelve and said to them,",
        "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.",
        "He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,",
        "Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.",
        "John said to him,",
        "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he was not following us.",
        "But Jesus said,",
        "Do not stop him, because no one who does a miracle in my name will be able soon afterward to say anything bad about me.",
        "For whoever is not against us is for us.",
        "For I tell you the truth, whoever gives you a cup of water because you bear Christ’s name will never lose his reward.",
        "If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a huge millstone tied around his neck and to be thrown into the sea.",
        "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than to have two hands and go into hell, to the unquenchable fire.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out! It is better to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,",
        "where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched.",
        "Everyone will be salted with fire.",
        "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other.",
        "Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan River. Again crowds gathered to him, and again, as was his custom, he taught them.",
        "Then some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked,",
        "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?",
        "He answered them,",
        "What did Moses command you?",
        "They said,",
        "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.",
        "But Jesus said to them,",
        "He wrote this commandment for you because of your hard hearts.",
        "But from the beginning of creation he made them male and female.",
        "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother,",
        "and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh.",
        "Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.",
        "In the house once again, the disciples asked him about this.",
        "So he told them,",
        "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.",
        "And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.",
        "Now people were bringing little children to him for him to touch, but the disciples scolded those who brought them.",
        "But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them,",
        "Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.",
        "I tell you the truth, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.",
        "After he took the children in his arms, he placed his hands on them and blessed them.",
        "Now as Jesus was starting out on his way, someone ran up to him, fell on his knees, and said,",
        "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.",
        "You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.’",
        "The man said to him,",
        "Teacher, I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.",
        "As Jesus looked at him, he felt love for him and said,",
        "You lack one thing. Go, sell whatever you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.",
        "But at this statement, the man looked sad and went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.",
        "Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,",
        "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!",
        "The disciples were astonished at these words. But again Jesus said to them,",
        "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!",
        "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.",
        "They were even more astonished and said to one another,",
        "Then who can be saved?",
        "Jesus looked at them and replied,",
        "This is impossible for mere humans, but not for God; all things are possible for God.",
        "Peter began to speak to him,",
        "Look, we have left everything to follow you!",
        "Jesus said,",
        "I tell you the truth, there is no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the gospel",
        "who will not receive in this age a hundred times as much &#8211; homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, fields, all with persecutions &#8211; and in the age to come, eternal life.",
        "But many who are first will be last, and the last first.",
        "They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem. Jesus was going ahead of them, and they were amazed, but those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.",
        "Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and experts in the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles.",
        "They will mock him, spit on him, flog him severely, and kill him. Yet after three days, he will rise again.",
        "Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said,",
        "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.",
        "He said to them,",
        "What do you want me to do for you?",
        "They said to him,",
        "Permit one of us to sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your glory.",
        "But Jesus said to them,",
        "You don’t know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I experience?",
        "They said to him,",
        "We are able. Then Jesus said to them,",
        "You will drink the cup I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism I experience,",
        "but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give. It is for those for whom it has been prepared.",
        "Now when the other ten heard this, they became angry with James and John.",
        "Jesus called them and said to them,",
        "You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them.",
        "But it is not this way among you. Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,",
        "and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all.",
        "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.",
        "They came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.",
        "When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to shout,",
        "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!",
        "Many scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more,",
        "Son of David, have mercy on me!",
        "Jesus stopped and said,",
        "Call him. So they called the blind man and said to him,",
        "Have courage! Get up! He is calling you.",
        "He threw off his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus.",
        "Then Jesus said to him,",
        "What do you want me to do for you? The blind man replied,",
        "Rabbi, let me see again.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Go, your faith has healed you. Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the road.",
        "Now as they approached Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples",
        "and said to them,",
        "Go to the village ahead of you. As soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here.",
        "If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here soon.’",
        "So they went and found a colt tied at a door, outside in the street, and untied it.",
        "Some people standing there said to them,",
        "What are you doing, untying that colt?",
        "They replied as Jesus had told them, and the bystanders let them go.",
        "Then they brought the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.",
        "Many spread their cloaks on the road and others spread branches they had cut in the fields.",
        "Both those who went ahead and those who followed kept shouting,",
        "Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!",
        "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!",
        "Then Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. And after looking around at everything, he went out to Bethany with the twelve since it was already late.",
        "Now the next day, as they went out from Bethany, he was hungry.",
        "After noticing in the distance a fig tree with leaves, he went to see if he could find any fruit on it. When he came to it he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.",
        "He said to it,",
        "May no one ever eat fruit from you again. And his disciples heard it.",
        "Then they came to Jerusalem. Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were selling and buying in the temple courts. He turned over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves,",
        "and he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.",
        "Then he began to teach them and said,",
        "Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have turned it into a den of robbers!",
        "The chief priests and the experts in the law heard it and they considered how they could assassinate him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed by his teaching.",
        "When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.",
        "In the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.",
        "Peter remembered and said to him,",
        "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered.",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "Have faith in God.",
        "I tell you the truth, if someone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.",
        "For this reason I tell you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.",
        "Whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven will also forgive you your sins.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "They came again to Jerusalem. While Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the experts in the law, and the elders came up to him",
        "and said,",
        "By what authority are you doing these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:",
        "John’s baptism &#8211; was it from heaven or from people? Answer me.",
        "They discussed with one another, saying,",
        "If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’",
        "But if we say, ‘From people &#8211; ’ (they feared the crowd, for they all considered John to be truly a prophet).",
        "So they answered Jesus,",
        "We don’t know. Then Jesus said to them,",
        "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.",
        "Then he began to speak to them in parables:",
        "A man planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a pit for its winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went on a journey.",
        "At harvest time he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his portion of the crop.",
        "But those tenants seized his slave, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.",
        "So he sent another slave to them again. This one they struck on the head and treated outrageously.",
        "He sent another, and that one they killed. This happened to many others, some of whom were beaten, others killed.",
        "He had one left, his one dear son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’",
        "But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’",
        "So they seized him, killed him, and threw his body out of the vineyard.",
        "What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.",
        "Have you not read this scripture: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.",
        "This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?",
        "Now they wanted to arrest him (but they feared the crowd), because they realized that he told this parable against them. So they left him and went away.",
        "Then they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to trap him with his own words.",
        "When they came they said to him,",
        "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and do not court anyone’s favor, because you show no partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or shouldn’t we?",
        "But he saw through their hypocrisy and said to them,",
        "Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.",
        "So they brought one, and he said to them,",
        "Whose image is this, and whose inscription? They replied,",
        "Caesar’s.",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they were utterly amazed at him.",
        "Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) also came to him and asked him,",
        "Teacher, Moses wrote for us: ‘If a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, that man must marry the widow and father children for his brother.’",
        "There were seven brothers. The first one married, and when he died he had no children.",
        "The second married her and died without any children, and likewise the third.",
        "None of the seven had children. Finally, the woman died too.",
        "In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her.",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "Aren’t you deceived for this reason, because you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God?",
        "For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.",
        "Now as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?",
        "He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are badly mistaken!",
        "Now one of the experts in the law came and heard them debating. When he saw that Jesus answered them well, he asked him,",
        "Which commandment is the most important of all?",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "The most important is: ‘Listen, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.",
        "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’",
        "The second is: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.",
        "The expert in the law said to him,",
        "That is true, Teacher; you are right to say that he is one, and there is no one else besides him.",
        "And to love him with all your heart, with all your mind, and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.",
        "When Jesus saw that he had answered thoughtfully, he said to him,",
        "You are not far from the kingdom of God. Then no one dared any longer to question him.",
        "While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he said,",
        "How is it that the experts in the law say that the Christ is David’s son?",
        "David himself, by the Holy Spirit, said, ‘The Lord said to my lord,",
        "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.’",
        "If David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son? And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.",
        "In his teaching Jesus also said,",
        "Watch out for the experts in the law. They like walking around in long robes and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces,",
        "and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.",
        "They devour widows’ property, and as a show make long prayers. These men will receive a more severe punishment.",
        "Then he sat down opposite the offering box, and watched the crowd putting coins into it. Many rich people were throwing in large amounts.",
        "And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny.",
        "He called his disciples and said to them,",
        "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the offering box than all the others.",
        "For they all gave out of their wealth. But she, out of her poverty, put in what she had to live on, everything she had.",
        "Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts, one of his disciples said to him,",
        "Teacher, look at these tremendous stones and buildings!",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another. All will be torn down!",
        "So while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,",
        "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that all these things are about to take place?",
        "Jesus began to say to them,",
        "Watch out that no one misleads you.",
        "Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and they will mislead many.",
        "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come.",
        "For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines. These are but the beginning of birth pains.",
        "You must watch out for yourselves. You will be handed over to councils and beaten in the synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings because of me, as a witness to them.",
        "First the gospel must be preached to all nations.",
        "When they arrest you and hand you over for trial, do not worry about what to speak. But say whatever is given you at that time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.",
        "Brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against parents and have them put to death.",
        "You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.",
        "But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.",
        "The one on the roof must not come down or go inside to take anything out of his house.",
        "The one in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.",
        "Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!",
        "Pray that it may not be in winter.",
        "For in those days there will be suffering unlike anything that has happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, or ever will happen.",
        "And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would be saved. But because of the elect, whom he chose, he has cut them short.",
        "Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe him.",
        "For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, the elect.",
        "Be careful! I have told you everything ahead of time.",
        "But in those days, after that suffering, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light;",
        "the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.",
        "Then everyone will see the Son of Man arriving in the clouds with great power and glory.",
        "Then he will send angels and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.",
        "Learn this parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near.",
        "So also you, when you see these things happening, know that he is near, right at the door.",
        "I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.",
        "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.",
        "But as for that day or hour no one knows it &#8211; neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son &#8211; except the Father.",
        "Watch out! Stay alert! For you do not know when the time will come.",
        "It is like a man going on a journey. He left his house and put his slaves in charge, assigning to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to stay alert.",
        "Stay alert, then, because you do not know when the owner of the house will return &#8211; whether during evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn &#8211;",
        "or else he might find you asleep when he returns suddenly.",
        "What I say to you I say to everyone: Stay alert!",
        "Two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the chief priests and the experts in the law were trying to find a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.",
        "For they said,",
        "Not during the feast, so there won’t be a riot among the people.",
        "Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of costly aromatic oil from pure nard. After breaking open the jar, she poured it on his head.",
        "But some who were present indignantly said to one another,",
        "Why this waste of expensive ointment?",
        "It could have been sold for more than three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor! So they spoke angrily to her.",
        "But Jesus said,",
        "Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a good service for me.",
        "For you will always have the poor with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want. But you will not always have me!",
        "She did what she could. She anointed my body beforehand for burial.",
        "I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.",
        "Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus into their hands.",
        "When they heard this, they were delighted and promised to give him money. So Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray him.",
        "Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples said to him,",
        "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?",
        "He sent two of his disciples and told them,",
        "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.",
        "Wherever he enters, tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says,",
        "Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’",
        "He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.",
        "So the disciples left, went into the city, and found things just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.",
        "Then, when it was evening, he came to the house with the twelve.",
        "While they were at the table eating, Jesus said,",
        "I tell you the truth, one of you eating with me will betray me.",
        "They were distressed, and one by one said to him,",
        "Surely not I?",
        "He said to them,",
        "It is one of the twelve, one who dips his hand with me into the bowl.",
        "For the Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born.",
        "While they were eating, he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to them, and said,",
        "Take it. This is my body.",
        "And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.",
        "He said to them,",
        "This is my blood, the blood of the covenant, that is poured out for many.",
        "I tell you the truth, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.",
        "After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "You will all fall away, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’",
        "But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.",
        "Peter said to him,",
        "Even if they all fall away, I will not!",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "I tell you the truth, today &#8211; this very night &#8211; before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.",
        "But Peter insisted emphatically,",
        "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you. And all of them said the same thing.",
        "Then they went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples,",
        "Sit here while I pray.",
        "He took Peter, James, and John with him, and became very troubled and distressed.",
        "He said to them,",
        "My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay alert.",
        "Going a little farther, he threw himself to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour would pass from him.",
        "He said,",
        "Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.",
        "Then he came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,",
        "Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you stay awake for one hour?",
        "Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.",
        "He went away again and prayed the same thing.",
        "When he came again he found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open. And they did not know what to tell him.",
        "He came a third time and said to them,",
        "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough of that! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
        "Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer is approaching!",
        "Right away, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him came a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and experts in the law and elders.",
        "(Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying,",
        "The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him and lead him away under guard.)",
        "When Judas arrived, he went up to Jesus immediately and said,",
        "Rabbi! and kissed him.",
        "Then they took hold of him and arrested him.",
        "One of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his ear.",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw?",
        "Day after day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, yet you did not arrest me. But this has happened so that the scriptures would be fulfilled.",
        "Then all the disciples left him and fled.",
        "A young man was following him, wearing only a linen cloth. They tried to arrest him,",
        "but he ran off naked, leaving his linen cloth behind.",
        "Then they led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and experts in the law came together.",
        "And Peter had followed him from a distance, up to the high priest’s courtyard. He was sitting with the guards and warming himself by the fire.",
        "The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find anything.",
        "Many gave false testimony against him, but their testimony did not agree.",
        "Some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:",
        "We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days build another not made with hands.’",
        "Yet even on this point their testimony did not agree.",
        "Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus,",
        "Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?",
        "But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest questioned him,",
        "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?",
        "I am, said Jesus,",
        "and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.",
        "Then the high priest tore his clothes and said,",
        "Why do we still need witnesses?",
        "You have heard the blasphemy! What is your verdict? They all condemned him as deserving death.",
        "Then some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and to strike him with their fists, saying,",
        "Prophesy! The guards also took him and beat him.",
        "Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s slave girls came by.",
        "When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked directly at him and said,",
        "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus.",
        "But he denied it:",
        "I don’t even understand what you’re talking about! Then he went out to the gateway, and a rooster crowed.",
        "When the slave girl saw him, she began again to say to the bystanders,",
        "This man is one of them.",
        "But he denied it again. A short time later the bystanders again said to Peter,",
        "You must be one of them, because you are also a Galilean.",
        "Then he began to curse, and he swore with an oath,",
        "I do not know this man you are talking about!",
        "Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him:",
        "Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times. And he broke down and wept.",
        "Early in the morning, after forming a plan, the chief priests with the elders and the experts in the law and the whole Sanhedrin tied Jesus up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.",
        "So Pilate asked him,",
        "Are you the king of the Jews? He replied,",
        "You say so.",
        "Then the chief priests began to accuse him repeatedly.",
        "So Pilate asked him again,",
        "Have you nothing to say? See how many charges they are bringing against you!",
        "But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.",
        "During the feast it was customary to release one prisoner to the people, whomever they requested.",
        "A man named Barabbas was imprisoned with rebels who had committed murder during an insurrection.",
        "Then the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to release a prisoner for them, as was his custom.",
        "So Pilate asked them,",
        "Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?",
        "(For he knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.)",
        "But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas instead.",
        "So Pilate spoke to them again,",
        "Then what do you want me to do with the one you call king of the Jews?",
        "They shouted back,",
        "Crucify him!",
        "Pilate asked them,",
        "Why? What has he done wrong? But they shouted more insistently,",
        "Crucify him!",
        "Because he wanted to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them. Then, after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.",
        "So the soldiers led him into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called together the whole cohort.",
        "They put a purple cloak on him and after braiding a crown of thorns, they put it on him.",
        "They began to salute him:",
        "Hail, king of the Jews!",
        "Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Then they knelt down and paid homage to him.",
        "When they had finished mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.",
        "The soldiers forced a passerby to carry his cross, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country (he was the father of Alexander and Rufus).",
        "They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha (which is translated,",
        "Place of the Skull).",
        "They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.",
        "Then they crucified him and divided his clothes, throwing dice for them, to decide what each would take.",
        "It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him.",
        "The inscription of the charge against him read,",
        "The king of the Jews.",
        "And they crucified two outlaws with him, one on his right and one on his left.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "Those who passed by defamed him, shaking their heads and saying,",
        "Aha! You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,",
        "save yourself and come down from the cross!",
        "In the same way even the chief priests &#8211; together with the experts in the law &#8211; were mocking him among themselves:",
        "He saved others, but he cannot save himself!",
        "Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now, that we may see and believe! Those who were crucified with him also spoke abusively to him.",
        "Now when it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.",

        "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?",
        "When some of the bystanders heard it they said,",
        "Listen, he is calling for Elijah!",
        "Then someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink, saying,",
        "Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah will come to take him down!",
        "But Jesus cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last.",
        "And the temple curtain was torn in two, from top to bottom.",
        "Now when the centurion, who stood in front of him, saw how he died, he said,",
        "Truly this man was God’s Son!",
        "There were also women, watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.",
        "When he was in Galilee, they had followed him and given him support. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were there too.",
        "Now when evening had already come, since it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath),",
        "Joseph of Arimathea, a highly regarded member of the council, who was himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.",
        "Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. He called the centurion and asked him if he had been dead for some time.",
        "When Pilate was informed by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.",
        "After Joseph bought a linen cloth and took down the body, he wrapped it in the linen and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone across the entrance of the tomb.",
        "Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was placed.",
        "When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought aromatic spices so that they might go and anoint him.",
        "And very early on the first day of the week, at sunrise, they went to the tomb.",
        "They had been asking each other,",
        "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?",
        "But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled back.",
        "Then as they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.",
        "But he said to them,",
        "Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has been raised! He is not here. Look, there is the place where they laid him.",
        "But go, tell his disciples, even Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.",
        "Then they went out and ran from the tomb, for terror and bewilderment had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.",
        "[[Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.",
        "She went out and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping.",
        "And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.",
        "After this he appeared in a different form to two of them while they were on their way to the country.",
        "They went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.",
        "Then he appeared to the eleven themselves, while they were eating, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him resurrected.",
        "He said to them,",

        "The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who does not believe will be condemned.",
        "These signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;",
        "they will pick up snakes with their hands, and whatever poison they drink will not harm them; they will place their hands on the sick and they will be well.",
        "After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.",
        "They went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs.]]",

        "like the accounts passed on to us by those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning.",
        "So it seemed good to me as well, because I have followed all things carefully from the beginning, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,",
        "so that you may know for certain the things you were taught.",
        "During the reign of Herod king of Judea, there lived a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and he had a wife named Elizabeth, who was a descendant of Aaron.",
        "They were both righteous in the sight of God, following all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly.",
        "But they did not have a child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both very old.",
        "Now while Zechariah was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,",
        "he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the holy place of the Lord and burn incense.",
        "Now the whole crowd of people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.",
        "An angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense, appeared to him.",
        "And Zechariah, visibly shaken when he saw the angel, was seized with fear.",
        "But the angel said to him,",
        "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son; you will name him John.",
        "Joy and gladness will come to you, and many will rejoice at his birth,",
        "for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth.",
        "He will turn many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.",
        "And he will go as forerunner before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers back to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.",
        "Zechariah said to the angel,",
        "How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is old as well.",
        "The angel answered him,",
        "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.",
        "And now, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time, you will be silent, unable to speak, until the day these things take place.",
        "Now the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they began to wonder why he was delayed in the holy place.",
        "When he came out, he was not able to speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision in the holy place, because he was making signs to them and remained unable to speak.",
        "When his time of service was over, he went to his home.",
        "After some time his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, and for five months she kept herself in seclusion. She said,",
        "This is what the Lord has done for me at the time when he has been gracious to me, to take away my disgrace among people.",
        "In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,",
        "to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, a descendant of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.",
        "The angel came to her and said,",
        "Greetings, favored one, the Lord is with you!",
        "But she was greatly troubled by his words and began to wonder about the meaning of this greeting.",
        "So the angel said to her,",
        "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God!",
        "Listen: You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.",
        "He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.",
        "He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.",
        "Mary said to the angel,",
        "How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?",
        "The angel replied,",
        "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called the Son of God.",
        "And look, your relative Elizabeth has also become pregnant with a son in her old age &#8211; although she was called barren, she is now in her sixth month!",
        "For nothing will be impossible with God.",
        "So Mary said,",
        "Yes, I am a servant of the Lord; let this happen to me according to your word. Then the angel departed from her.",
        "In those days Mary got up and went hurriedly into the hill country, to a town of Judah,",
        "and entered Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.",
        "When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.",
        "She exclaimed with a loud voice,",
        "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child in your womb!",
        "And who am I that the mother of my Lord should come and visit me?",
        "For the instant the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.",
        "And blessed is she who believed that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled.",
        "And Mary said,",
        "My soul exalts the Lord,",
        "and my spirit has begun to rejoice in God my Savior,",
        "because he has looked upon the humble state of his servant. For from now on all generations will call me blessed,",
        "because he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name;",
        "from generation to generation he is merciful to those who fear him.",
        "He has demonstrated power with his arm; he has scattered those whose pride wells up from the sheer arrogance of their hearts.",
        "He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up those of lowly position;",
        "he has filled the hungry with good things, and has sent the rich away empty.",
        "He has helped his servant Israel, remembering his mercy,",
        "as he promised to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.",
        "So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then returned to her home.",
        "Now the time came for Elizabeth to have her baby, and she gave birth to a son.",
        "Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.",
        "On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they wanted to name him Zechariah after his father.",
        "But his mother replied,",
        "No! He must be named John.",
        "They said to her,",
        "But none of your relatives bears this name.",
        "So they made signs to the baby’s father, inquiring what he wanted to name his son.",
        "He asked for a writing tablet and wrote,",
        "His name is John. And they were all amazed.",
        "Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue released, and he spoke, blessing God.",
        "All their neighbors were filled with fear, and throughout the entire hill country of Judea all these things were talked about.",
        "All who heard these things kept them in their hearts, saying,",
        "What then will this child be? For the Lord’s hand was indeed with him.",
        "Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied,",
        "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, because he has come to help and has redeemed his people.",
        "For he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,",
        "as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago,",
        "that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us.",
        "He has done this to show mercy to our ancestors, and to remember his holy covenant &#8211;",
        "the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham. This oath grants",
        "that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, may serve him without fear,",
        "in holiness and righteousness before him for as long as we live.",
        "And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High. For you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,",
        "to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins.",
        "Because of our God’s tender mercy the dawn will break upon us from on high",
        "to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.",
        "And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he was revealed to Israel.",
        "Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire for taxes.",
        "This was the first registration, taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.",
        "Everyone went to his own town to be registered.",
        "So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David.",
        "He went to be registered with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him, and who was expecting a child.",
        "While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child.",
        "And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.",
        "Now there were shepherds nearby living out in the field, keeping guard over their flock at night.",
        "An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were absolutely terrified.",
        "But the angel said to them,",
        "Do not be afraid! Listen carefully, for I proclaim to you good news that brings great joy to all the people:",
        "Today your Savior is born in the city of David. He is Christ the Lord.",
        "This will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.",
        "Suddenly a vast, heavenly army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,",
        "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased!",
        "When the angels left them and went back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another,",
        "Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, that the Lord has made known to us.",
        "So they hurried off and located Mary and Joseph, and found the baby lying in a manger.",
        "When they saw him, they related what they had been told about this child,",
        "and all who heard it were astonished at what the shepherds said.",
        "But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering in her heart what they might mean.",
        "So the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen; everything was just as they had been told.",
        "At the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.",
        "Now when the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary brought Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord",
        "(just as it is written in the law of the Lord,",
        "Every firstborn male will be set apart to the Lord),",
        "and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord, a pair of doves or two young pigeons.",
        "Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon who was righteous and devout, looking for the restoration of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.",
        "It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.",
        "So Simeon, directed by the Spirit, came into the temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary according to the law,",
        "Simeon took him in his arms and blessed God, saying,",
        "Now, according to your word, Sovereign Lord, permit your servant to depart in peace.",
        "For my eyes have seen your salvation",
        "that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples:",
        "a light, for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.",
        "So the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him.",
        "Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary,",
        "Listen carefully: This child is destined to be the cause of the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be rejected.",
        "Indeed, as a result of him the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed &#8211; and a sword will pierce your own soul as well!",
        "There was also a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having been married to her husband for seven years until his death.",
        "She had lived as a widow since then for eighty-four years. She never left the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day.",
        "At that moment, she came up to them and began to give thanks to God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.",
        "So when Joseph and Mary had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.",
        "And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.",
        "Now Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem every year for the feast of the Passover.",
        "When he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom.",
        "But when the feast was over, as they were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,",
        "but (because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers) they went a day’s journey. Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances.",
        "When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.",
        "After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.",
        "And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers.",
        "When his parents saw him, they were overwhelmed. His mother said to him,",
        "Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.",
        "But he replied,",
        "Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?",
        "Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them.",
        "Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. But his mother kept all these things in her heart.",
        "And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with people.",
        "In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,",
        "during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.",
        "He went into all the region around the Jordan River, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.",
        "As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,",
        "The voice of one shouting in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight.",
        "Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be brought low, and the crooked will be made straight, and the rough ways will be made smooth,",
        "and all humanity will see the salvation of God.’",
        "So John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him,",
        "You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?",
        "Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance, and don’t begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones!",
        "Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.",
        "So the crowds were asking him,",
        "What then should we do?",
        "John answered them,",
        "The person who has two tunics must share with the person who has none, and the person who has food must do likewise.",
        "Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him,",
        "Teacher, what should we do?",
        "He told them,",
        "Collect no more than you are required to.",
        "Then some soldiers also asked him,",
        "And as for us &#8211; what should we do? He told them,",
        "Take money from no one by violence or by false accusation, and be content with your pay.",
        "While the people were filled with anticipation and they all wondered whether perhaps John could be the Christ,",
        "John answered them all,",
        "I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I am is coming &#8211; I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.",
        "His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with inextinguishable fire.",
        "And in this way, with many other exhortations, John proclaimed good news to the people.",
        "But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the evil deeds that he had done,",
        "Herod added this to them all: He locked up John in prison.",
        "Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized. And while he was praying, the heavens opened,",
        "and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven,",
        "You are my one dear Son; in you I take great delight.",

        "Jesus answered him,",
        "It is written, ‘Man does not live by bread alone.’",
        "Then the devil led him up to a high place and showed him in a flash all the kingdoms of the world.",
        "And he said to him,",
        "To you I will grant this whole realm &#8211; and the glory that goes along with it, for it has been relinquished to me, and I can give it to anyone I wish.",
        "So then, if you will worship me, all this will be yours.",

        "He began to teach in their synagogues and was praised by all.",
        "Now Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read,",
        "and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,",
        "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and the regaining of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed,",
        "to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.",
        "Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him.",
        "Then he began to tell them,",
        "Today this scripture has been fulfilled even as you heard it being read.",
        "All were speaking well of him, and were amazed at the gracious words coming out of his mouth. They said,",
        "Isn’t this Joseph’s son?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "No doubt you will quote to me the proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ and say, ‘What we have heard that you did in Capernaum, do here in your hometown too.’",
        "And he added,",
        "I tell you the truth, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.",
        "But in truth I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s days, when the sky was shut up three and a half years, and there was a great famine over all the land.",
        "Yet Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to a woman who was a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.",
        "And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, yet none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.",
        "When they heard this, all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage.",
        "They got up, forced him out of the town, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.",
        "But he passed through the crowd and went on his way.",
        "So he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he began to teach the people.",
        "They were amazed at his teaching, because he spoke with authority.",
        "Now in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,",
        "Ha! Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are &#8211; the Holy One of God.",
        "But Jesus rebuked him:",
        "Silence! Come out of him! Then, after the demon threw the man down in their midst, he came out of him without hurting him.",
        "They were all amazed and began to say to one another,",
        "What’s happening here? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!",
        "So the news about him spread into all areas of the region.",
        "After Jesus left the synagogue, he entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.",
        "So he stood over her, commanded the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and began to serve them.",
        "As the sun was setting, all those who had any relatives sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus. He placed his hands on every one of them and healed them.",
        "Demons also came out of many, crying out,",
        "You are the Son of God! But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.",
        "The next morning Jesus departed and went to a deserted place. Yet the crowds were seeking him, and they came to him and tried to keep him from leaving them.",
        "But Jesus said to them,",
        "I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns too, for that is what I was sent to do.",
        "So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea.",
        "Now Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing around him to hear the word of God.",
        "He saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.",
        "He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.",
        "When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,",
        "Put out into the deep water and lower your nets for a catch.",
        "Simon answered,",
        "Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing! But at your word I will lower the nets.",
        "When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets started to tear.",
        "So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they were about to sink.",
        "But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,",
        "Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!",
        "For Peter and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,",
        "and so were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s business partners. Then Jesus said to Simon,",
        "Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.",
        "So when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.",
        "While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came to him who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he bowed down with his face to the ground and begged him,",
        "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.",
        "So he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying,",
        "I am willing. Be clean! And immediately the leprosy left him.",
        "Then he ordered the man to tell no one, but commanded him,",
        "Go and show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.",
        "But the news about him spread even more, and large crowds were gathering together to hear him and to be healed of their illnesses.",
        "Yet Jesus himself frequently withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.",
        "Now on one of those days, while he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting nearby (who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem), and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.",
        "Just then some men showed up, carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were trying to bring him in and place him before Jesus.",
        "But since they found no way to carry him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down on the stretcher through the roof tiles right in front of Jesus.",
        "When Jesus saw their faith he said,",
        "Friend, your sins are forgiven.",
        "Then the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to think to themselves,",
        "Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?",
        "When Jesus perceived their hostile thoughts, he said to them,",
        "Why are you raising objections within yourselves?",
        "Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?",
        "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins &#8211; he said to the paralyzed man &#8211;",
        "I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher and go home.",
        "Immediately he stood up before them, picked up the stretcher he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God.",
        "Then astonishment seized them all, and they glorified God. They were filled with awe, saying,",
        "We have seen incredible things today.",
        "After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth.",
        "Follow me, he said to him.",
        "And he got up and followed him, leaving everything behind.",
        "Then Levi gave a great banquet in his house for Jesus, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table with them.",
        "But the Pharisees and their experts in the law complained to his disciples, saying,",
        "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?",
        "Jesus answered them,",
        "Those who are well don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do.",
        "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.",
        "Then they said to him,",
        "John’s disciples frequently fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours continue to eat and drink.",
        "So Jesus said to them,",
        "You cannot make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?",
        "But those days are coming, and when the bridegroom is taken from them, at that time they will fast.",
        "He also told them a parable:",
        "No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, he will have torn the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.",
        "And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.",
        "Instead new wine must be poured into new wineskins.",
        "No one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, ‘The old is good enough.’",
        "Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples picked some heads of wheat, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them.",
        "But some of the Pharisees said,",
        "Why are you doing what is against the law on the Sabbath?",
        "Jesus answered them,",
        "Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry &#8211;",
        "how he entered the house of God, took and ate the sacred bread, which is not lawful for any to eat but the priests alone, and gave it to his companions?",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.",
        "On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching. Now a man was there whose right hand was withered.",
        "The experts in the law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they could find a reason to accuse him.",
        "But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand,",
        "Get up and stand here. So he rose and stood there.",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "I ask you, is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?",
        "After looking around at them all, he said to the man,",
        "Stretch out your hand. The man did so, and his hand was restored.",
        "But they were filled with mindless rage and began debating with one another what they would do to Jesus.",
        "Now it was during this time that Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and he spent all night in prayer to God.",
        "When morning came, he called his disciples and chose twelve of them, whom he also named apostles:",
        "Simon (whom he named Peter), and his brother Andrew; and James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,",
        "Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,",
        "Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.",
        "Then he came down with them and stood on a level place. And a large number of his disciples had gathered along with a vast multitude from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon. They came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,",
        "and those who suffered from unclean spirits were cured.",
        "The whole crowd was trying to touch him, because power was coming out from him and healing them all.",
        "Then he looked up at his disciples and said:",
        "Blessed are you who are poor, for the kingdom of God belongs to you.",
        "Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied.",
        "Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.",
        "Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and reject you as evil on account of the Son of Man!",
        "Rejoice in that day, and jump for joy, because your reward is great in heaven. For their ancestors did the same things to the prophets.",
        "But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your comfort already.",
        "Woe to you who are well satisfied with food now, for you will be hungry.",
        "Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.",
        "Woe to you when all people speak well of you, for their ancestors did the same things to the false prophets.",
        "But I say to you who are listening: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,",
        "bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.",
        "To the person who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other as well, and from the person who takes away your coat, do not withhold your tunic either.",
        "Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask for your possessions back from the person who takes them away.",
        "Treat others in the same way that you would want them to treat you.",
        "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.",
        "And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same.",
        "And if you lend to those from whom you hope to be repaid, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, so that they may be repaid in full.",
        "But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to ungrateful and evil people.",
        "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.",
        "Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.",
        "Give, and it will be given to you: A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be poured into your lap. For the measure you use will be the measure you receive.",
        "He also told them a parable:",
        "Someone who is blind cannot lead another who is blind, can he? Won’t they both fall into a pit?",
        "A disciple is not greater than his teacher, but everyone when fully trained will be like his teacher.",
        "Why do you see the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to see the beam of wood in your own?",
        "How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck from your eye,’ while you yourself don’t see the beam in your own? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.",
        "For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit,",
        "for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from brambles.",
        "The good person out of the good treasury of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasury produces evil, for his mouth speaks from what fills his heart.",
        "Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and don’t do what I tell you?",
        "Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and puts them into practice &#8211; I will show you what he is like:",
        "He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep, and laid the foundation on bedrock. When a flood came, the river burst against that house but could not shake it, because it had been well built.",
        "But the person who hears and does not put my words into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against that house, it collapsed immediately, and was utterly destroyed!",
        "After Jesus had finished teaching all this to the people, he entered Capernaum.",
        "A centurion there had a slave who was highly regarded, but who was sick and at the point of death.",
        "When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, asking him to come and heal his slave.",
        "When they came to Jesus, they urged him earnestly,",
        "He is worthy to have you do this for him,",
        "because he loves our nation, and even built our synagogue.",
        "So Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him,",
        "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.",
        "That is why I did not presume to come to you. Instead, say the word, and my servant must be healed.",
        "For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.",
        "When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. He turned and said to the crowd that followed him,",
        "I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith!",
        "So when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave well.",
        "Soon afterward Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.",
        "As he approached the town gate, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother (who was a widow), and a large crowd from the town was with her.",
        "When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her,",
        "Do not weep.",
        "Then he came up and touched the bier, and those who carried it stood still. He said,",
        "Young man, I say to you, get up!",
        "So the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.",
        "Fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying,",
        "A great prophet has appeared among us! and",
        "God has come to help his people!",
        "This report about Jesus circulated throughout Judea and all the surrounding country.",
        "John’s disciples informed him about all these things. So John called two of his disciples",
        "and sent them to Jesus to ask,",
        "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?",
        "When the men came to Jesus, they said,",
        "John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?’",
        "At that very time Jesus cured many people of diseases, sicknesses, and evil spirits, and granted sight to many who were blind.",
        "So he answered them,",
        "Go tell John what you have seen and heard: The blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have good news proclaimed to them.",
        "Blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.",
        "When John’s messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John:",
        "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?",
        "What did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? Look, those who wear fancy clothes and live in luxury are in kings’ courts!",
        "What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.",
        "This is the one about whom it is written, ‘Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’",
        "I tell you, among those born of women no one is greater than John. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he is.",
        "(Now all the people who heard this, even the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice, because they had been baptized with John’s baptism.",
        "However, the Pharisees and the experts in religious law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)",
        "To what then should I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?",
        "They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another, ‘We played the flute for you, yet you did not dance; we wailed in mourning, yet you did not weep.’",
        "For John the Baptist has come eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’",
        "The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him, a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’",
        "But wisdom is vindicated by all her children.",
        "Now one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went into the Pharisee’s house and took his place at the table.",
        "Then when a woman of that town, who was a sinner, learned that Jesus was dining at the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfumed oil.",
        "As she stood behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. She wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them with the perfumed oil.",
        "Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself,",
        "If this man were a prophet, he would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.",
        "So Jesus answered him,",
        "Simon, I have something to say to you. He replied,",
        "Say it, Teacher.",
        "A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed him five hundred silver coins, and the other fifty.",
        "When they could not pay, he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?",
        "Simon answered,",
        "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled. Jesus said to him,",
        "You have judged rightly.",
        "Then, turning toward the woman, he said to Simon,",
        "Do you see this woman? I entered your house. You gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.",
        "You gave me no kiss of greeting, but from the time I entered she has not stopped kissing my feet.",
        "You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfumed oil.",
        "Therefore I tell you, her sins, which were many, are forgiven, thus she loved much; but the one who is forgiven little loves little.",
        "Then Jesus said to her,",
        "Your sins are forgiven.",
        "But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves,",
        "Who is this, who even forgives sins?",
        "He said to the woman,",
        "Your faith has saved you; go in peace.",
        "Some time afterward he went on through towns and villages, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him,",
        "and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and disabilities: Mary (called Magdalene), from whom seven demons had gone out,",
        "and Joanna the wife of Cuza (Herod’s household manager), Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their own resources.",
        "While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one town after another, he spoke to them in a parable:",
        "A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled on, and the wild birds devoured it.",
        "Other seed fell on rock, and when it came up, it withered because it had no moisture.",
        "Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up with it and choked it.",
        "But other seed fell on good soil and grew, and it produced a hundred times as much grain. As he said this, he called out,",
        "The one who has ears to hear had better listen!",
        "Then his disciples asked him what this parable meant.",
        "He said,",
        "You have been given the opportunity to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that although they see they may not see, and although they hear they may not understand.",
        "Now the parable means this: The seed is the word of God.",
        "Those along the path are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.",
        "Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in a time of testing fall away.",
        "As for the seed that fell among thorns, these are the ones who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.",
        "But as for the seed that landed on good soil, these are the ones who, after hearing the word, cling to it with an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with steadfast endurance.",
        "No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in can see the light.",
        "For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light.",
        "So listen carefully, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.",
        "Now Jesus’ mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not get near him because of the crowd.",
        "So he was told,",
        "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.",
        "But he replied to them,",
        "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.",
        "One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them,",
        "Let’s go across to the other side of the lake. So they set out,",
        "and as they sailed he fell asleep. Now a violent windstorm came down on the lake, and the boat started filling up with water, and they were in danger.",
        "They came and woke him, saying,",
        "Master, Master, we are about to die! So he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they died down, and it was calm.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Where is your faith? But they were afraid and amazed, saying to one another,",
        "Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!",
        "So they sailed over to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.",
        "As Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man from the town met him who was possessed by demons. For a long time this man had worn no clothes and had not lived in a house, but among the tombs.",
        "When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and shouted with a loud voice,",
        "Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I beg you, do not torment me!",
        "For Jesus had started commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man. (For it had seized him many times, so he would be bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard. But he would break the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.)",
        "Jesus then asked him,",
        "What is your name? He said,",
        "Legion, because many demons had entered him.",
        "And they began to beg him not to order them to depart into the abyss.",
        "Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and the demonic spirits begged Jesus to let them go into them. He gave them permission.",
        "So the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd of pigs rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned.",
        "When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside.",
        "So the people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus. They found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.",
        "Those who had seen it told them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed.",
        "Then all the people of the Gerasenes and the surrounding region asked Jesus to leave them alone, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and left.",
        "The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,",
        "Return to your home, and declare what God has done for you. So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town what Jesus had done for him.",
        "Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, because they were all waiting for him.",
        "Then a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue, came up. Falling at Jesus’ feet, he pleaded with him to come to his house,",
        "because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds pressed around him.",
        "Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years but could not be healed by anyone.",
        "She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak, and at once the bleeding stopped.",
        "Then Jesus asked,",
        "Who was it who touched me? When they all denied it, Peter said,",
        "Master, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing against you!",
        "But Jesus said,",
        "Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out from me.",
        "When the woman saw that she could not escape notice, she came trembling and fell down before him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed.",
        "Then he said to her,",
        "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.",
        "While he was still speaking, someone from the synagogue ruler’s house came and said,",
        "Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the teacher any longer.",
        "But when Jesus heard this, he told him,",
        "Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.",
        "Now when he came to the house, Jesus did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother.",
        "Now they were all wailing and mourning for her, but he said,",
        "Stop your weeping; she is not dead but asleep.",
        "And they began making fun of him, because they knew that she was dead.",
        "But Jesus gently took her by the hand and said,",
        "Child, get up.",
        "Her spirit returned, and she got up immediately. Then he told them to give her something to eat.",
        "Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.",
        "After Jesus called the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,",
        "and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.",
        "He said to them,",
        "Take nothing for your journey &#8211; no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, and do not take an extra tunic.",
        "Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave the area.",
        "Wherever they do not receive you, as you leave that town, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.",
        "Then they departed and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.",
        "Now Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening, and he was thoroughly perplexed, because some people were saying that John had been raised from the dead,",
        "while others were saying that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had risen.",
        "Herod said,",
        "I had John beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things? So Herod wanted to learn about Jesus.",
        "When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.",
        "But when the crowds found out, they followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and cured those who needed healing.",
        "Now the day began to draw to a close, so the twelve came and said to Jesus,",
        "Send the crowd away, so they can go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and food, because we are in an isolated place.",
        "But he said to them,",
        "You give them something to eat. They replied,",
        "We have no more than five loaves and two fish &#8211; unless we go and buy food for all these people.",
        "(Now about five thousand men were there.) Then he said to his disciples,",
        "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.",
        "So they did as Jesus directed, and the people all sat down.",
        "Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke them. He gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.",
        "They all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up &#8211; twelve baskets of broken pieces.",
        "Once when Jesus was praying by himself, and his disciples were nearby, he asked them,",
        "Who do the crowds say that I am?",
        "They answered,",
        "John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others that one of the prophets of long ago has risen.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "But who do you say that I am? Peter answered,",
        "The Christ of God.",
        "But he forcefully commanded them not to tell this to anyone,",
        "saying,",
        "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.",
        "Then he said to them all,",
        "If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.",
        "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.",
        "For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?",
        "For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.",
        "But I tell you most certainly, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God.",
        "Now about eight days after these sayings, Jesus took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up the mountain to pray.",
        "As he was praying, the appearance of his face was transformed, and his clothes became very bright, a brilliant white.",
        "Then two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with him.",
        "They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke about his departure that he was about to carry out at Jerusalem.",
        "Now Peter and those with him were quite sleepy, but as they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.",
        "Then as the men were starting to leave, Peter said to Jesus,",
        "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah &#8211; not knowing what he was saying.",
        "As he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.",
        "Then a voice came from the cloud, saying,",
        "This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him!",
        "After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. So they kept silent and told no one at that time anything of what they had seen.",
        "Now on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.",
        "Then a man from the crowd cried out,",
        "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son &#8211; he is my only child!",
        "A spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions and causes him to foam at the mouth. It hardly ever leaves him alone, torturing him severely.",
        "I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not do so.",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "You unbelieving and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here.",
        "As the boy was approaching, the demon threw him to the ground and shook him with convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.",
        "Then they were all astonished at the mighty power of God.But while the entire crowd was amazed at everything Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples,",
        "Take these words to heart, for the Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.",
        "But they did not understand this statement; its meaning had been concealed from them, so that they could not grasp it. Yet they were afraid to ask him about this statement.",
        "Now an argument started among the disciples as to which of them might be the greatest.",
        "But when Jesus discerned their innermost thoughts, he took a child, had him stand by his side,",
        "and said to them,",
        "Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me, for the one who is least among you all is the one who is great.",
        "John answered,",
        "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he is not a disciple along with us.",
        "But Jesus said to him,",
        "Do not stop him, for whoever is not against you is for you.",
        "Now when the days drew near for him to be taken up, Jesus set out resolutely to go to Jerusalem.",
        "He sent messengers on ahead of him. As they went along, they entered a Samaritan village to make things ready in advance for him,",
        "but the villagers refused to welcome him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem.",
        "Now when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,",
        "Lord, do you want us to call fire to come down from heaven and consume them?",
        "But Jesus turned and rebuked them,",
        "and they went on to another village.",
        "As they were walking along the road, someone said to him,",
        "I will follow you wherever you go.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.",
        "Jesus said to another,",
        "Follow me. But he replied,",
        "Lord, first let me go and bury my father.",
        "But Jesus said to him,",
        "Let the dead bury their own dead, but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.",
        "Yet another said,",
        "I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to my family.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.",
        "After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him two by two into every town and place where he himself was about to go.",
        "He said to them,",
        "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.",
        "Go! I am sending you out like lambs surrounded by wolves.",
        "Do not carry a money bag, a traveler’s bag, or sandals, and greet no one on the road.",
        "Whenever you enter a house, first say, ‘May peace be on this house!’",
        "And if a peace-loving person is there, your peace will remain on him, but if not, it will return to you.",
        "Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they give you, for the worker deserves his pay. Do not move around from house to house.",
        "Whenever you enter a town and the people welcome you, eat what is set before you.",
        "Heal the sick in that town and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come upon you!’",
        "But whenever you enter a town and the people do not welcome you, go into its streets and say,",
        "‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this: The kingdom of God has come.’",
        "I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town!",
        "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.",
        "But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you!",
        "And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be thrown down to Hades!",
        "The one who listens to you listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.",
        "Then the seventy-two returned with joy, saying,",
        "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name!",
        "So he said to them,",
        "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.",
        "Look, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and on the full force of the enemy, and nothing will hurt you.",
        "Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names stand written in heaven.",
        "On that same occasion Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said,",
        "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will.",
        "All things have been given to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him.",
        "Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said privately,",
        "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!",
        "For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.",
        "Now an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus, saying,",
        "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?",
        "He said to him,",
        "What is written in the law? How do you understand it?",
        "The expert answered,",
        "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.",
        "But the expert, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus,",
        "And who is my neighbor?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him up, and went off, leaving him half dead.",
        "Now by chance a priest was going down that road, but when he saw the injured man he passed by on the other side.",
        "So too a Levite, when he came up to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.",
        "But a Samaritan who was traveling came to where the injured man was, and when he saw him, he felt compassion for him.",
        "He went up to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.",
        "The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him, and whatever else you spend, I will repay you when I come back this way.’",
        "Which of these three do you think became a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?",
        "The expert in religious law said,",
        "The one who showed mercy to him. So Jesus said to him,",
        "Go and do the same.",
        "Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed him as a guest.",
        "She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to what he said.",
        "But Martha was distracted with all the preparations she had to make, so she came up to him and said,",
        "Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do all the work alone? Tell her to help me.",
        "But the Lord answered her,",
        "Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things,",
        "but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the best part; it will not be taken away from her.",
        "Now Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he stopped, one of his disciples said to him,",
        "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.",
        "So he said to them,",
        "When you pray, say: Father, may your name be honored; may your kingdom come.",
        "Give us each day our daily bread,",
        "and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And do not lead us into temptation.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,",
        "because a friend of mine has stopped here while on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’",
        "Then he will reply from inside, ‘Do not bother me. The door is already shut, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything.’",
        "I tell you, even though the man inside will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of the first man’s sheer persistence he will get up and give him whatever he needs.",
        "So I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.",
        "For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.",
        "What father among you, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish?",
        "Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?",
        "If you then, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!",
        "Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the man who had been mute began to speak, and the crowds were amazed.",
        "But some of them said,",
        "By the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, he casts out demons.",
        "Others, to test him, began asking for a sign from heaven.",
        "But Jesus, realizing their thoughts, said to them,",
        "Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and a divided household falls.",
        "So if Satan too is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? I ask you this because you claim that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.",
        "Now if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.",
        "But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has already overtaken you.",
        "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are safe.",
        "But when a stronger man attacks and conquers him, he takes away the first man’s armor on which the man relied and divides up his plunder.",
        "Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.",
        "When an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it passes through waterless places looking for rest but not finding any. Then it says, ‘I will return to the home I left.’",
        "When it returns, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.",
        "Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so the last state of that person is worse than the first.",
        "As he said these things, a woman in the crowd spoke out to him,",
        "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed!",
        "But he replied,",
        "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it!",
        "As the crowds were increasing, Jesus began to say,",
        "This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.",
        "For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.",
        "The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon &#8211; and now, something greater than Solomon is here!",
        "The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented when Jonah preached to them &#8211; and now, something greater than Jonah is here!",
        "No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in can see the light.",
        "Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light, but when it is diseased, your body is full of darkness.",
        "Therefore see to it that the light in you is not darkness.",
        "If then your whole body is full of light, with no part in the dark, it will be as full of light as when the light of a lamp shines on you.",
        "As he spoke, a Pharisee invited Jesus to have a meal with him, so he went in and took his place at the table.",
        "The Pharisee was astonished when he saw that Jesus did not first wash his hands before the meal.",
        "But the Lord said to him,",
        "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.",
        "You fools! Didn’t the one who made the outside make the inside as well?",
        "But give from your heart to those in need, and then everything will be clean for you.",
        "But woe to you Pharisees! You give a tenth of your mint, rue, and every herb, yet you neglect justice and love for God! But you should have done these things without neglecting the others.",
        "Woe to you Pharisees! You love the best seats in the synagogues and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces!",
        "Woe to you! You are like unmarked graves, and people walk over them without realizing it!",
        "One of the experts in religious law answered him,",
        "Teacher, when you say these things you insult us too.",
        "But Jesus replied,",
        "Woe to you experts in religious law as well! You load people down with burdens difficult to bear, yet you yourselves refuse to touch the burdens with even one of your fingers!",
        "Woe to you! You build the tombs of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.",
        "So you testify that you approve of the deeds of your ancestors, because they killed the prophets and you build their tombs!",
        "For this reason also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’",
        "so that this generation may be held accountable for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,",
        "from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.",
        "Woe to you experts in religious law! You have taken away the key to knowledge! You did not go in yourselves, and you hindered those who were going in.",
        "When he went out from there, the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to oppose him bitterly, and to ask him hostile questions about many things,",
        "plotting against him, to catch him in something he might say.",
        "Meanwhile, when many thousands of the crowd had gathered so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples,",
        "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.",
        "Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing is secret that will not be made known.",
        "So then whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.",
        "I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more they can do.",
        "But I will warn you whom you should fear: Fear the one who, after the killing, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!",
        "Aren’t five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.",
        "In fact, even the hairs on your head are all numbered. Do not be afraid; you are more valuable than many sparrows.",
        "I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before God’s angels.",
        "But the one who denies me before men will be denied before God’s angels.",
        "And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the person who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.",
        "But when they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about how you should make your defense or what you should say,",
        "for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you must say.",
        "Then someone from the crowd said to him,",
        "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.",
        "But Jesus said to him,",
        "Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator between you two?",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Watch out and guard yourself from all types of greed, because one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.",
        "He then told them a parable:",
        "The land of a certain rich man produced an abundant crop,",
        "so he thought to himself, ‘What should I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’",
        "Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.",
        "And I will say to myself,",
        "You have plenty of goods stored up for many years; relax, eat, drink, celebrate!’",
        "But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded back from you, but who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’",
        "So it is with the one who stores up riches for himself, but is not rich toward God.",
        "Then Jesus said to his disciples,",
        "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.",
        "For there is more to life than food, and more to the body than clothing.",
        "Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!",
        "And which of you by worrying can add an hour to his life?",
        "So if you cannot do such a very little thing as this, why do you worry about the rest?",
        "Consider how the flowers grow; they do not work or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these!",
        "And if this is how God clothes the wild grass, which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you people of little faith!",
        "So do not be overly concerned about what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not worry about such things.",
        "For all the nations of the world pursue these things, and your Father knows that you need them.",
        "Instead, pursue his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.",
        "Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom.",
        "Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide yourselves purses that do not wear out &#8211; a treasure in heaven that never decreases, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.",
        "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.",
        "Get dressed for service and keep your lamps burning;",
        "be like people waiting for their master to come back from the wedding celebration, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.",
        "Blessed are those slaves whom their master finds alert when he returns! I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, have them take their place at the table, and will come and wait on them!",
        "Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and finds them alert, blessed are those slaves!",
        "But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.",
        "You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.",
        "Then Peter said,",
        "Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for everyone?",
        "The Lord replied,",
        "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his household servants, to give them their allowance of food at the proper time?",
        "Blessed is that slave whom his master finds at work when he returns.",
        "I tell you the truth, the master will put him in charge of all his possessions.",
        "But if that slave should say to himself, ‘My master is delayed in returning,’ and he begins to beat the other slaves, both men and women, and to eat, drink, and get drunk,",
        "then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee, and will cut him in two, and assign him a place with the unfaithful.",
        "That servant who knew his master’s will but did not get ready or do what his master asked will receive a severe beating.",
        "But the one who did not know his master’s will and did things worthy of punishment will receive a light beating. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required, and from the one who has been entrusted with much, even more will be asked.",
        "I have come to bring fire on the earth &#8211; and how I wish it were already kindled!",
        "I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is finished!",
        "Do you think I have come to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!",
        "For from now on there will be five in one household divided, three against two and two against three.",
        "They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.",
        "Jesus also said to the crowds,",
        "When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, ‘A rainstorm is coming,’ and it does.",
        "And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat,’ and there is.",
        "You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how can you not know how to interpret the present time?",
        "And why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?",
        "As you are going with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, so that he will not drag you before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.",
        "Now there were some present on that occasion who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.",
        "He answered them,",
        "Do you think these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered these things?",
        "No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you will all perish as well!",
        "Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them, do you think they were worse offenders than all the others who live in Jerusalem?",
        "No, I tell you! But unless you repent you will all perish as well!",
        "Then Jesus told this parable:",
        "A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.",
        "So he said to the worker who tended the vineyard, ‘For three years now, I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and each time I inspect it I find none. Cut it down! Why should it continue to deplete the soil?’",
        "But the worker answered him, ‘Sir, leave it alone this year too, until I dig around it and put fertilizer on it.",
        "Then if it bears fruit next year, very well, but if not, you can cut it down.’",
        "Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath,",
        "and a woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten herself up completely.",
        "When Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said,",
        "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.",
        "Then he placed his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.",
        "But the president of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd,",
        "There are six days on which work should be done! So come and be healed on those days, and not on the Sabbath day.",
        "Then the Lord answered him,",
        "You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from its stall, and lead it to water?",
        "Then shouldn’t this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, be released from this imprisonment on the Sabbath day?",
        "When he said this all his adversaries were humiliated, but the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things he was doing.",
        "Thus Jesus asked,",
        "What is the kingdom of God like? To what should I compare it?",
        "It is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the wild birds nested in its branches.",
        "Again he said,",
        "To what should I compare the kingdom of God?",
        "It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen.",
        "Then Jesus traveled throughout towns and villages, teaching and making his way toward Jerusalem.",
        "Someone asked him,",
        "Lord, will only a few be saved? So he said to them,",
        "Exert every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.",
        "Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, then you will stand outside and start to knock on the door and beg him, ‘Lord, let us in!’ But he will answer you, ‘I don’t know where you come from.’",
        "Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’",
        "But he will reply, ‘I don’t know where you come from! Go away from me, all you evildoers!’",
        "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves thrown out.",
        "Then people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and take their places at the banquet table in the kingdom of God.",
        "But indeed, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.",
        "At that time, some Pharisees came up and said to Jesus,",
        "Get away from here, because Herod wants to kill you.",
        "But he said to them,",
        "Go and tell that fox, ‘Look, I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will complete my work.",
        "Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, because it is impossible that a prophet should be killed outside Jerusalem.’",
        "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would have none of it!",
        "Look, your house is forsaken! And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’",
        "Now one Sabbath when Jesus went to dine at the house of a leader of the Pharisees, they were watching him closely.",
        "There right in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.",
        "So Jesus asked the experts in religious law and the Pharisees,",
        "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?",
        "But they remained silent. So Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Which of you, if you have a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?",
        "But they could not reply to this.",
        "Then when Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. He said to them,",
        "When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, because a person more distinguished than you may have been invited by your host.",
        "So the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this man your place.’ Then, ashamed, you will begin to move to the least important place.",
        "But when you are invited, go and take the least important place, so that when your host approaches he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up here to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who share the meal with you.",
        "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.",
        "He said also to the man who had invited him,",
        "When you host a dinner or a banquet, don’t invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors so you can be invited by them in return and get repaid.",
        "But when you host an elaborate meal, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.",
        "Then you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.",
        "When one of those at the meal with Jesus heard this, he said to him,",
        "Blessed is everyone who will feast in the kingdom of God!",
        "But Jesus said to him,",
        "A man once gave a great banquet and invited many guests.",
        "At the time for the banquet he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, because everything is now ready.’",
        "But one after another they all began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please excuse me.’",
        "Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going out to examine them. Please excuse me.’",
        "Another said, ‘I just got married, and I cannot come.’",
        "So the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the master of the household was furious and said to his slave, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’",
        "Then the slave said, ‘Sir, what you instructed has been done, and there is still room.’",
        "So the master said to his slave, ‘Go out to the highways and country roads and urge people to come in, so that my house will be filled.",
        "For I tell you, not one of those individuals who were invited will taste my banquet!’",
        "Now large crowds were accompanying Jesus, and turning to them he said,",
        "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.",
        "Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.",
        "For which of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn’t sit down first and compute the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?",
        "Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish the tower, all who see it will begin to make fun of him.",
        "They will say, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish!’",
        "Or what king, going out to confront another king in battle, will not sit down first and determine whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?",
        "If he cannot succeed, he will send a representative while the other is still a long way off and ask for terms of peace.",
        "In the same way therefore not one of you can be my disciple if he does not renounce all his own possessions.",
        "Salt is good, but if salt loses its flavor, how can its flavor be restored?",
        "It is of no value for the soil or for the manure pile; it is to be thrown out. The one who has ears to hear had better listen!",
        "Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming to hear him.",
        "But the Pharisees and the experts in the law were complaining,",
        "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.",
        "So Jesus told them this parable:",
        "Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go look for the one that is lost until he finds it?",
        "Then when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing.",
        "Returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, telling them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.’",
        "I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to repent.",
        "Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search thoroughly until she finds it?",
        "Then when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’",
        "In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents.",
        "Then Jesus said,",
        "A man had two sons.",
        "The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that will belong to me.’ So he divided his assets between them.",
        "After a few days, the younger son gathered together all he had and left on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth with a wild lifestyle.",
        "Then after he had spent everything, a severe famine took place in that country, and he began to be in need.",
        "So he went and worked for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.",
        "He was longing to eat the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.",
        "But when he came to his senses he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have food enough to spare, but here I am dying from hunger!",
        "I will get up and go to my father and say to him,",
        "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.",
        "I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired workers.’",
        "So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way from home his father saw him, and his heart went out to him; he ran and hugged his son and kissed him.",
        "Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’",
        "But the father said to his slaves, ‘Hurry! Bring the best robe, and put it on him! Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet!",
        "Bring the fattened calf and kill it! Let us eat and celebrate,",
        "because this son of mine was dead, and is alive again &#8211; he was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.",
        "Now his older son was in the field. As he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.",
        "So he called one of the slaves and asked what was happening.",
        "The slave replied, ‘Your brother has returned, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got his son back safe and sound.’",
        "But the older son became angry and refused to go in. His father came out and appealed to him,",
        "but he answered his father, ‘Look! These many years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never disobeyed your commands. Yet you never gave me even a goat so that I could celebrate with my friends!",
        "But when this son of yours came back, who has devoured your assets with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’",
        "Then the father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and everything that belongs to me is yours.",
        "It was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost and is found.’",
        "Jesus also said to the disciples,",
        "There was a rich man who was informed of accusations that his manager was wasting his assets.",
        "So he called the manager in and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in the account of your administration, because you can no longer be my manager.’",
        "Then the manager said to himself, ‘What should I do, since my master is taking my position away from me? I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m too ashamed to beg.",
        "I know what to do so that when I am put out of management, people will welcome me into their homes.’",
        "So he contacted his master’s debtors one by one. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’",
        "The man replied, ‘A hundred measures of olive oil.’ The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.’",
        "Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ The second man replied, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’",
        "The master commended the dishonest manager because he acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their contemporaries than the people of light.",
        "And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by how you use worldly wealth, so that when it runs out you will be welcomed into the eternal homes.",
        "The one who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and the one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.",
        "If then you haven’t been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will entrust you with the true riches?",
        "And if you haven’t been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you your own?",
        "No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.",
        "The Pharisees (who loved money) heard all this and ridiculed him.",
        "But Jesus said to them,",
        "You are the ones who justify yourselves in men’s eyes, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly prized among men is utterly detestable in God’s sight.",
        "The law and the prophets were in force until John; since then, the good news of the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is urged to enter it.",
        "But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a letter in the law to become void.",
        "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery, and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.",
        "There was a rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.",
        "But at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus whose body was covered with sores,",
        "who longed to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. In addition, the dogs came and licked his sores.",
        "Now the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried.",
        "And in hell, as he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far off with Lazarus at his side.",
        "So he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this fire.’",
        "But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things and Lazarus likewise bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish.",
        "Besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us, so that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.’",
        "So the rich man said, ‘Then I beg you, father &#8211; send Lazarus to my father’s house",
        "(for I have five brothers) to warn them so that they don’t come into this place of torment.’",
        "But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; they must respond to them.’",
        "Then the rich man said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’",
        "He replied to him, ‘If they do not respond to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’",
        "Jesus said to his disciples,",
        "Stumbling blocks are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come!",
        "It would be better for him to have a millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.",
        "Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.",
        "Even if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to you saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.",
        "The apostles said to the Lord,",
        "Increase our faith!",
        "So the Lord replied,",
        "If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this black mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled out by the roots and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.",
        "Would any one of you say to your slave who comes in from the field after plowing or shepherding sheep, ‘Come at once and sit down for a meal’?",
        "Won’t the master instead say to him, ‘Get my dinner ready, and make yourself ready to serve me while I eat and drink. Then you may eat and drink’?",
        "He won’t thank the slave because he did what he was told, will he?",
        "So you too, when you have done everything you were commanded to do, should say, ‘We are slaves undeserving of special praise; we have only done what was our duty.’",
        "Now on the way to Jerusalem, Jesus was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.",
        "As he was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met him. They stood at a distance,",
        "raised their voices and said,",
        "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.",
        "When he saw them he said,",
        "Go and show yourselves to the priests. And as they went along, they were cleansed.",
        "Then one of them, when he saw he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice.",
        "He fell with his face to the ground at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. (Now he was a Samaritan.)",
        "Then Jesus said,",
        "Were not ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?",
        "Was no one found to turn back and give praise to God except this foreigner?",
        "Then he said to the man,",
        "Get up and go your way. Your faith has made you well.",
        "Now at one point the Pharisees asked Jesus when the kingdom of God was coming, so he answered,",
        "The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed,",
        "nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is in your midst.",
        "Then he said to the disciples,",
        "The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.",
        "Then people will say to you, ‘Look, there he is!’ or ‘Look, here he is!’ Do not go out or chase after them.",
        "For just like the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.",
        "But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.",
        "Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man.",
        "People were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage &#8211; right up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.",
        "Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot, people were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building;",
        "but on the day Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.",
        "It will be the same on the day the Son of Man is revealed.",
        "On that day, anyone who is on the roof, with his goods in the house, must not come down to take them away, and likewise the person in the field must not turn back.",
        "Remember Lot’s wife!",
        "Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.",
        "I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.",
        "There will be two women grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "Then the disciples said to him,",
        "Where, Lord? He replied to them,",
        "Where the dead body is, there the vultures will gather.",
        "Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart.",
        "He said,",
        "In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people.",
        "There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’",
        "For a while he refused, but later on he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people,",
        "yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas.’",
        "And the Lord said,",
        "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says!",
        "Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them?",
        "I tell you, he will give them justice speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?",
        "Jesus also told this parable to some who were confident that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else.",
        "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.",
        "The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people: extortionists, unrighteous people, adulterers &#8211; or even like this tax collector.",
        "I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of everything I get.’",
        "The tax collector, however, stood far off and would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, be merciful to me, sinner that I am!’",
        "I tell you that this man went down to his home justified rather than the Pharisee. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.",
        "Now people were even bringing their babies to him for him to touch. But when the disciples saw it, they began to scold those who brought them.",
        "But Jesus called for the children, saying,",
        "Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.",
        "I tell you the truth, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.",
        "Now a certain ruler asked him,",
        "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.",
        "You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’",
        "The man replied,",
        "I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.",
        "When Jesus heard this, he said to him,",
        "One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.",
        "But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy.",
        "When Jesus noticed this, he said,",
        "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!",
        "In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.",
        "Those who heard this said,",
        "Then who can be saved?",
        "He replied,",
        "What is impossible for mere humans is possible for God.",
        "And Peter said,",
        "Look, we have left everything we own to follow you!",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "I tell you the truth, there is no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of God’s kingdom",
        "who will not receive many times more in this age &#8211; and in the age to come, eternal life.",
        "Then Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them,",
        "Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.",
        "For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; he will be mocked, mistreated, and spat on.",
        "They will flog him severely and kill him. Yet on the third day he will rise again.",
        "But the twelve understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what Jesus meant.",
        "As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging.",
        "When he heard a crowd going by, he asked what was going on.",
        "They told him,",
        "Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.",
        "So he called out,",
        "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!",
        "And those who were in front scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted even more,",
        "Son of David, have mercy on me!",
        "So Jesus stopped and ordered the beggar to be brought to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him,",
        "What do you want me to do for you? He replied,",
        "Lord, let me see again.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.",
        "And immediately he regained his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they too gave praise to God.",
        "Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it.",
        "Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector and was rich.",
        "He was trying to get a look at Jesus, but being a short man he could not see over the crowd.",
        "So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way.",
        "And when Jesus came to that place, he looked up and said to him,",
        "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because I must stay at your house today.",
        "So he came down quickly and welcomed Jesus joyfully.",
        "And when the people saw it, they all complained,",
        "He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.",
        "But Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord,",
        "Look, Lord, half of my possessions I now give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back four times as much!",
        "Then Jesus said to him,",
        "Today salvation has come to this household, because he too is a son of Abraham!",
        "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.",
        "While the people were listening to these things, Jesus proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.",
        "Therefore he said,",
        "A nobleman went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.",
        "And he summoned ten of his slaves, gave them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Do business with these until I come back.’",
        "But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to be king over us!’",
        "When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he summoned these slaves to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much they had earned by trading.",
        "So the first one came before him and said, ‘Sir, your mina has made ten minas more.’",
        "And the king said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you will have authority over ten cities.’",
        "Then the second one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has made five minas.’",
        "So the king said to him, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’",
        "Then another slave came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina that I put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth.",
        "For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’",
        "The king said to him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked slave! So you knew, did you, that I was a severe man, withdrawing what I didn’t deposit and reaping what I didn’t sow?",
        "Why then didn’t you put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I could have collected it with interest?’",
        "And he said to his attendants, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has ten.’",
        "But they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas already!’",
        "‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.",
        "But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king, bring them here and slaughter them in front of me!’",
        "After Jesus had said this, he continued on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.",
        "Now when he approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,",
        "telling them,",
        "Go to the village ahead of you. When you enter it, you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here.",
        "If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ just say, ‘The Lord needs it.’",
        "So those who were sent ahead found it exactly as he had told them.",
        "As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them,",
        "Why are you untying that colt?",
        "They replied,",
        "The Lord needs it.",
        "Then they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and had Jesus get on it.",
        "As he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road.",
        "As he approached the road leading down from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen:",
        "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!",
        "But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him,",
        "Teacher, rebuke your disciples.",
        "He answered,",
        "I tell you, if they keep silent, the very stones will cry out!",
        "Now when Jesus approached and saw the city, he wept over it,",
        "saying,",
        "If you had only known on this day, even you, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.",
        "For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and surround you and close in on you from every side.",
        "They will demolish you &#8211; you and your children within your walls &#8211; and they will not leave within you one stone on top of another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.",
        "Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling things there,",
        "saying to them,",
        "It is written, ‘My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have turned it into a den of robbers!",
        "Jesus was teaching daily in the temple courts. The chief priests and the experts in the law and the prominent leaders among the people were seeking to assassinate him,",
        "but they could not find a way to do it, for all the people hung on his words.",
        "Now one day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the experts in the law with the elders came up",
        "and said to him,",
        "Tell us: By what authority are you doing these things? Or who it is who gave you this authority?",
        "He answered them,",
        "I will also ask you a question, and you tell me:",
        "John’s baptism &#8211; was it from heaven or from people?",
        "So they discussed it with one another, saying,",
        "If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’",
        "But if we say, ‘From people,’ all the people will stone us, because they are convinced that John was a prophet.",
        "So they replied that they did not know where it came from.",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "Neither will I tell you by whose authority I do these things.",
        "Then he began to tell the people this parable:",
        "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.",
        "When harvest time came, he sent a slave to the tenants so that they would give him his portion of the crop. However, the tenants beat his slave and sent him away empty-handed.",
        "So he sent another slave. They beat this one too, treated him outrageously, and sent him away empty-handed.",
        "So he sent still a third. They even wounded this one, and threw him out.",
        "Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my one dear son; perhaps they will respect him.’",
        "But when the tenants saw him, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir; let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours!’",
        "So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?",
        "He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others. When the people heard this, they said,",
        "May this never happen!",
        "But Jesus looked straight at them and said,",
        "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?",
        "Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be crushed.",
        "Then the experts in the law and the chief priests wanted to arrest him that very hour, because they realized he had told this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.",
        "Then they watched him carefully and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They wanted to take advantage of what he might say so that they could deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor.",
        "Thus they asked him,",
        "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly, and show no partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.",
        "Is it right for us to pay the tribute tax to Caesar or not?",
        "But Jesus perceived their deceit and said to them,",
        "Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it? They said,",
        "Caesar’s.",
        "So he said to them,",
        "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.",
        "Thus they were unable in the presence of the people to trap him with his own words. And stunned by his answer, they fell silent.",
        "Now some Sadducees (who contend that there is no resurrection) came to him.",
        "They asked him,",
        "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies leaving a wife but no children, that man must marry the widow and father children for his brother.",
        "Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died without children.",
        "The second",
        "and then the third married her, and in this same way all seven died, leaving no children.",
        "Finally the woman died too.",
        "In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had married her.",
        "So Jesus said to them,",
        "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.",
        "But those who are regarded as worthy to share in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.",
        "In fact, they can no longer die, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, since they are sons of the resurrection.",
        "But even Moses revealed that the dead are raised in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.",
        "Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live before him.",
        "Then some of the experts in the law answered,",
        "Teacher, you have spoken well!",
        "For they did not dare any longer to ask him anything.",
        "But he said to them,",
        "How is it that they say that the Christ is David’s son?",
        "For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my lord,",
        "Sit at my right hand,",
        "until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.’",
        "If David then calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?",
        "As all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,",
        "Beware of the experts in the law. They like walking around in long robes, and they love elaborate greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.",
        "They devour widows’ property, and as a show make long prayers. They will receive a more severe punishment.",
        "Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box.",
        "He also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.",
        "He said,",
        "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put in more than all of them.",
        "For they all offered their gifts out of their wealth. But she, out of her poverty, put in everything she had to live on.",
        "Now while some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said,",
        "As for these things that you are gazing at, the days will come when not one stone will be left on another. All will be torn down!",
        "So they asked him,",
        "Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that these things are about to take place?",
        "He said,",
        "Watch out that you are not misled. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them!",
        "And when you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be afraid. For these things must happen first, but the end will not come at once.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.",
        "There will be great earthquakes, and famines and plagues in various places, and there will be terrifying sights and great signs from heaven.",
        "But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors because of my name.",
        "This will be a time for you to serve as witnesses.",
        "Therefore be resolved not to rehearse ahead of time how to make your defense.",
        "For I will give you the words along with the wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict.",
        "You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will have some of you put to death.",
        "You will be hated by everyone because of my name.",
        "Yet not a hair of your head will perish.",
        "By your endurance you will gain your lives.",
        "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.",
        "Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. Those who are inside the city must depart. Those who are out in the country must not enter it,",
        "because these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.",
        "Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people.",
        "They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away as captives among all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.",
        "And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth nations will be in distress, anxious over the roaring of the sea and the surging waves.",
        "People will be fainting from fear and from the expectation of what is coming on the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.",
        "Then they will see the Son of Man arriving in a cloud with power and great glory.",
        "But when these things begin to happen, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.",
        "Then he told them a parable:",
        "Look at the fig tree and all the other trees.",
        "When they sprout leaves, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near.",
        "So also you, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.",
        "I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.",
        "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.",
        "But be on your guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day close down upon you suddenly like a trap.",
        "For it will overtake all who live on the face of the whole earth.",
        "But stay alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that must happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.",
        "So every day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, but at night he went and stayed on the Mount of Olives.",
        "And all the people came to him early in the morning to listen to him in the temple courts.",
        "Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.",
        "The chief priests and the experts in the law were trying to find some way to execute Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.",
        "Then Satan entered Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was one of the twelve.",
        "He went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard how he might betray Jesus, handing him over to them.",
        "They were delighted and arranged to give him money.",
        "So Judas agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus when no crowd was present.",
        "Then the day for the feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.",
        "Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,",
        "Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat.",
        "They said to him,",
        "Where do you want us to prepare it?",
        "He said to them,",
        "Listen, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters,",
        "and tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you,",
        "Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’",
        "Then he will show you a large furnished room upstairs. Make preparations there.",
        "So they went and found things just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.",
        "Now when the hour came, Jesus took his place at the table and the apostles joined him.",
        "And he said to them,",
        "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.",
        "For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.",
        "Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said,",
        "Take this and divide it among yourselves.",
        "For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.",
        "Then he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying,",
        "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.",
        "And in the same way he took the cup after they had eaten, saying,",
        "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.",
        "But look, the hand of the one who betrays me is with me on the table.",
        "For the Son of Man is to go just as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!",
        "So they began to question one another as to which of them it could possibly be who would do this.",
        "A dispute also started among them over which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.",
        "So Jesus said to them,",
        "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’",
        "Not so with you; instead the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the one who serves.",
        "For who is greater, the one who is seated at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is seated at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.",
        "You are the ones who have remained with me in my trials.",
        "Thus I grant to you a kingdom, just as my Father granted to me,",
        "that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
        "Simon, Simon, pay attention! Satan has demanded to have you all, to sift you like wheat,",
        "but I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. When you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.",
        "But Peter said to him,",
        "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me.",
        "Then Jesus said to them,",
        "When I sent you out with no money bag, or traveler’s bag, or sandals, you didn’t lack anything, did you? They replied,",
        "Nothing.",
        "He said to them,",
        "But now, the one who has a money bag must take it, and likewise a traveler’s bag too. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.",
        "For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘And he was counted with the transgressors.’ For what is written about me is being fulfilled.",
        "So they said,",
        "Look, Lord, here are two swords. Then he told them,",
        "It is enough.",
        "Then Jesus went out and made his way, as he customarily did, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.",
        "When he came to the place, he said to them,",
        "Pray that you will not fall into temptation.",
        "He went away from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed,",
        "Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done.",
        "[Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.",
        "And in his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.]",
        "When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, exhausted from grief.",
        "So he said to them,",
        "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you will not fall into temptation!",
        "While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd appeared, and the man named Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He walked up to Jesus to kiss him.",
        "But Jesus said to him,",
        "Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?",
        "When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said,",
        "Lord, should we use our swords?",
        "Then one of them struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear.",
        "But Jesus said,",
        "Enough of this! And he touched the man’s ear and healed him.",
        "Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders who had come out to get him,",
        "Have you come out with swords and clubs like you would against an outlaw?",
        "Day after day when I was with you in the temple courts, you did not arrest me. But this is your hour, and that of the power of darkness!",
        "Then they arrested Jesus, led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter was following at a distance.",
        "When they had made a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.",
        "Then a slave girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, stared at him and said,",
        "This man was with him too!",
        "But Peter denied it:",
        "Woman, I don’t know him!",
        "Then a little later someone else saw him and said,",
        "You are one of them too. But Peter said,",
        "Man, I am not!",
        "And after about an hour still another insisted,",
        "Certainly this man was with him, because he too is a Galilean.",
        "But Peter said,",
        "Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about! At that moment, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.",
        "Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him,",
        "Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.",
        "And he went outside and wept bitterly.",
        "Now the men who were holding Jesus under guard began to mock him and beat him.",
        "They blindfolded him and asked him repeatedly,",
        "Prophesy! Who hit you?",
        "They also said many other things against him, reviling him.",
        "When day came, the council of the elders of the people gathered together, both the chief priests and the experts in the law. Then they led Jesus away to their council",
        "and said,",
        "If you are the Christ, tell us. But he said to them,",
        "If I tell you, you will not believe,",
        "and if I ask you, you will not answer.",
        "But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.",
        "So they all said,",
        "Are you the Son of God, then? He answered them,",
        "You say that I am.",
        "Then they said,",
        "Why do we need further testimony? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!",
        "Then the whole group of them rose up and brought Jesus before Pilate.",
        "They began to accuse him, saying,",
        "We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding us to pay the tribute tax to Caesar and claiming that he himself is Christ, a king.",
        "So Pilate asked Jesus,",
        "Are you the king of the Jews? He replied,",
        "You say so.",
        "Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds,",
        "I find no basis for an accusation against this man.",
        "But they persisted in saying,",
        "He incites the people by teaching throughout all Judea. It started in Galilee and ended up here!",
        "Now when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.",
        "When he learned that he was from Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who also happened to be in Jerusalem at that time.",
        "When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some miraculous sign.",
        "So Herod questioned him at considerable length; Jesus gave him no answer.",
        "The chief priests and the experts in the law were there, vehemently accusing him.",
        "Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, dressing him in elegant clothes, Herod sent him back to Pilate.",
        "That very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other, for prior to this they had been enemies.",
        "Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,",
        "and said to them,",
        "You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. When I examined him before you, I did not find this man guilty of anything you accused him of doing.",
        "Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, he has done nothing deserving death.",
        "I will therefore have him flogged and release him.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "But they all shouted out together,",
        "Take this man away! Release Barabbas for us!",
        "(This was a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder.)",
        "Pilate addressed them once again because he wanted to release Jesus.",
        "But they kept on shouting,",
        "Crucify, crucify him!",
        "A third time he said to them,",
        "Why? What wrong has he done? I have found him guilty of no crime deserving death. I will therefore flog him and release him.",
        "But they were insistent, demanding with loud shouts that he be crucified. And their shouts prevailed.",
        "So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.",
        "He released the man they asked for, who had been thrown in prison for insurrection and murder. But he handed Jesus over to their will.",
        "As they led him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country. They placed the cross on his back and made him carry it behind Jesus.",
        "A great number of the people followed him, among them women who were mourning and wailing for him.",
        "But Jesus turned to them and said,",
        "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.",
        "For this is certain: The days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore children, and the breasts that never nursed!’",
        "Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’",
        "For if such things are done when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?",
        "Two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him.",
        "So when they came to the place that is called",
        "The Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.",
        "[But Jesus said,",
        "Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.] Then they threw dice to divide his clothes.",
        "The people also stood there watching, but the rulers ridiculed him, saying,",
        "He saved others. Let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, his chosen one!",
        "The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine,",
        "and saying,",
        "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!",
        "There was also an inscription over him,",
        "This is the king of the Jews.",
        "One of the criminals who was hanging there railed at him, saying,",
        "Aren’t you the Christ? Save yourself and us!",
        "But the other rebuked him, saying,",
        "Don’t you fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?",
        "And we rightly so, for we are getting what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing wrong.",
        "Then he said,",
        "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.",
        "And Jesus said to him,",
        "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.",
        "It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,",
        "because the sun’s light failed. The temple curtain was torn in two.",
        "Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said,",
        "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit! And after he said this he breathed his last.",
        "Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God and said,",
        "Certainly this man was innocent!",
        "And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.",
        "And all those who knew Jesus stood at a distance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee saw these things.",
        "Now there was a man named Joseph who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man.",
        "(He had not consented to their plan and action.) He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and was looking forward to the kingdom of God.",
        "He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.",
        "Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock, where no one had yet been buried.",
        "It was the day of preparation and the Sabbath was beginning.",
        "The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.",
        "Then they returned and prepared aromatic spices and perfumes. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.",
        "Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women went to the tomb, taking the aromatic spices they had prepared.",
        "They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb,",
        "but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.",
        "While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood beside them in dazzling attire.",
        "The women were terribly frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them,",
        "Why do you look for the living among the dead?",
        "He is not here, but has been raised! Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,",
        "that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.",
        "Then the women remembered his words,",
        "and when they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.",
        "Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.",
        "But these words seemed like pure nonsense to them, and they did not believe them.",
        "But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down and saw only the strips of linen cloth; then he went home, wondering what had happened.",
        "Now that very day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.",
        "They were talking to each other about all the things that had happened.",
        "While they were talking and debating these things, Jesus himself approached and began to accompany them",
        "(but their eyes were kept from recognizing him).",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "What are these matters you are discussing so intently as you walk along? And they stood still, looking sad.",
        "Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him,",
        "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that have happened there in these days?",
        "He said to them,",
        "What things?",
        "The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, they replied,",
        "a man who, with his powerful deeds and words, proved to be a prophet before God and all the people;",
        "and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be condemned to death, and crucified him.",
        "But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Not only this, but it is now the third day since these things happened.",
        "Furthermore, some women of our group amazed us. They were at the tomb early this morning,",
        "and when they did not find his body, they came back and said they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.",
        "Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.",
        "So he said to them,",
        "You foolish people &#8211; how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!",
        "Wasn’t it necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into his glory?",
        "Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things written about himself in all the scriptures.",
        "So they approached the village where they were going. He acted as though he wanted to go farther,",
        "but they urged him,",
        "Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening and the day is almost done. So he went in to stay with them.",
        "When he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.",
        "At this point their eyes were opened and they recognized him. Then he vanished out of their sight.",
        "They said to each other,",
        "Didn’t our hearts burn within us while he was speaking with us on the road, while he was explaining the scriptures to us?",
        "So they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven and those with them gathered together",
        "and saying,",
        "The Lord has really risen, and has appeared to Simon!",
        "Then they told what had happened on the road, and how they recognized him when he broke the bread.",
        "While they were saying these things, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them,",
        "Peace be with you.",
        "But they were startled and terrified, thinking they saw a ghost.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?",
        "Look at my hands and my feet; it’s me! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones like you see I have.",
        "When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.",
        "And while they still could not believe it (because of their joy) and were amazed, he said to them,",
        "Do you have anything here to eat?",
        "So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,",
        "and he took it and ate it in front of them.",
        "Then he said to them,",
        "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.",
        "Then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures,",
        "and said to them,",
        "Thus it stands written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day,",
        "and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.",
        "You are witnesses of these things.",
        "And look, I am sending you what my Father promised. But stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.",
        "Then Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.",
        "Now during the blessing he departed and was taken up into heaven.",
        "So they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,",
        "and were continually in the temple courts blessing God.",
        "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was fully God.",
        "The Word was with God in the beginning.",
        "All things were created by him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created.",
        "In him was life, and the life was the light of mankind.",
        "And the light shines on in the darkness, but the darkness has not mastered it.",
        "A man came, sent from God, whose name was John.",
        "He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that everyone might believe through him.",
        "He himself was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.",
        "The true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.",
        "He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not recognize him.",
        "He came to what was his own, but his own people did not receive him.",
        "But to all who have received him &#8211; those who believe in his name &#8211; he has given the right to become God’s children",
        "&#8211; children not born by human parents or by human desire or a husband’s decision, but by God.",
        "Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We saw his glory &#8211; the glory of the one and only, full of grace and truth, who came from the Father.",
        "John testified about him and shouted out,",
        "This one was the one about whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is greater than I am, because he existed before me.’",
        "For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another.",
        "For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.",
        "No one has ever seen God. The only one, himself God, who is in closest fellowship with the Father, has made God known.",
        "Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him,",
        "Who are you?",
        "He confessed &#8211; he did not deny but confessed &#8211;",
        "I am not the Christ!",
        "So they asked him,",
        "Then who are you? Are you Elijah? He said,",
        "I am not!",
        "Are you the Prophet? He answered,",
        "No!",
        "Then they said to him,",
        "Who are you? Tell us so that we can give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?",
        "John said,",
        "I am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.",
        "(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)",
        "So they asked John,",
        "Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?",
        "John answered them,",
        "I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not recognize,",
        "who is coming after me. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal!",
        "These things happened in Bethany across the Jordan River where John was baptizing.",
        "On the next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said,",
        "Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!",
        "This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is greater than I am, because he existed before me.’",
        "I did not recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he could be revealed to Israel.",
        "Then John testified,",
        "I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained on him.",
        "And I did not recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining &#8211; this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’",
        "I have both seen and testified that this man is the Chosen One of God.",
        "Again the next day John was standing there with two of his disciples.",
        "Gazing at Jesus as he walked by, he said,",
        "Look, the Lamb of God!",
        "When John’s two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.",
        "Jesus turned around and saw them following and said to them,",
        "What do you want? So they said to him,",
        "Rabbi (which is translated Teacher),",
        "where are you staying?",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "Come and you will see. So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. Now it was about four o’clock in the afternoon.",
        "Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two disciples who heard what John said and followed Jesus.",
        "He first found his own brother Simon and told him,",
        "We have found the Messiah! (which is translated Christ).",
        "Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said,",
        "You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas (which is translated Peter).",
        "On the next day Jesus wanted to set out for Galilee. He found Philip and said to him,",
        "Follow me.",
        "(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.)",
        "Philip found Nathanael and told him,",
        "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets also wrote about &#8211; Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.",
        "Nathanael replied,",
        "Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip replied,",
        "Come and see.",
        "Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and exclaimed,",
        "Look, a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit!",
        "Nathanael asked him,",
        "How do you know me? Jesus replied,",
        "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.",
        "Nathanael answered him,",
        "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel!",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.",
        "He continued,",
        "I tell all of you the solemn truth &#8211; you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.",
        "Now on the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,",
        "and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.",
        "When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him,",
        "They have no wine left.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Woman, why are you saying this to me? My time has not yet come.",
        "His mother told the servants,",
        "Whatever he tells you, do it.",
        "Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washing, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.",
        "Jesus told the servants,",
        "Fill the water jars with water. So they filled them up to the very top.",
        "Then he told them,",
        "Now draw some out and take it to the head steward, and they did.",
        "When the head steward tasted the water that had been turned to wine, not knowing where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom",
        "and said to him,",
        "Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the cheaper wine when the guests are drunk. You have kept the good wine until now!",
        "Jesus did this as the first of his miraculous signs, in Cana of Galilee. In this way he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.",
        "After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there a few days.",
        "Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
        "He found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers sitting at tables.",
        "So he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, with the sheep and the oxen. He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.",
        "To those who sold the doves he said,",
        "Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace!",
        "His disciples remembered that it was written,",
        "Zeal for your house will devour me.",
        "So then the Jewish leaders responded,",
        "What sign can you show us, since you are doing these things?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up again.",
        "Then the Jewish leaders said to him,",
        "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and are you going to raise it up in three days?",
        "But Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body.",
        "So after he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken.",
        "Now while Jesus was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, many people believed in his name because they saw the miraculous signs he was doing.",
        "But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people.",
        "He did not need anyone to testify about man, for he knew what was in man.",
        "Now a certain man, a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish ruling council,",
        "came to Jesus at night and said to him,",
        "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.",
        "Nicodemus said to him,",
        "How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time, can he?",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.",
        "What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.",
        "Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must all be born from above.’",
        "The wind blows wherever it will, and you hear the sound it makes, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.",
        "Nicodemus replied,",
        "How can these things be?",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you don’t understand these things?",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, we speak about what we know and testify about what we have seen, but you people do not accept our testimony.",
        "If I have told you people about earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?",
        "No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven &#8211; the Son of Man.",
        "Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
        "so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.",
        "For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.",
        "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him.",
        "The one who believes in him is not condemned. The one who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.",
        "Now this is the basis for judging: that the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.",
        "For everyone who does evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed.",
        "But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be plainly evident that his deeds have been done in God.",
        "After this, Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing.",
        "John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming to him and being baptized.",
        "(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)",
        "Now a dispute came about between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew concerning ceremonial washing.",
        "So they came to John and said to him,",
        "Rabbi, the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, about whom you testified &#8211; see, he is baptizing, and everyone is flocking to him!",
        "John replied,",
        "No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.",
        "You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but rather, ‘I have been sent before him.’",
        "The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This then is my joy, and it is complete.",
        "He must become more important while I become less important.",
        "The one who comes from above is superior to all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is superior to all.",
        "He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.",
        "The one who has accepted his testimony has confirmed clearly that God is truthful.",
        "For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit sparingly.",
        "The Father loves the Son and has placed all things under his authority.",
        "The one who believes in the Son has eternal life. The one who rejects the Son will not see life, but God’s wrath remains on him.",
        "Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing more disciples than John",
        "(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were),",
        "he left Judea and set out once more for Galilee.",
        "But he had to pass through Samaria.",
        "Now he came to a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.",
        "Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, since he was tired from the journey, sat right down beside the well. It was about noon.",
        "A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her,",
        "Give me some water to drink.",
        "(For his disciples had gone off into the town to buy supplies.)",
        "So the Samaritan woman said to him,",
        "How can you &#8211; a Jew &#8211; ask me, a Samaritan woman, for water to drink? (For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.)",
        "Jesus answered her,",
        "If you had known the gift of God and who it is who said to you, ‘Give me some water to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.",
        "Sir, the woman said to him,",
        "you have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do you get this living water?",
        "Surely you’re not greater than our ancestor Jacob, are you? For he gave us this well and drank from it himself, along with his sons and his livestock.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Everyone who drinks some of this water will be thirsty again.",
        "But whoever drinks some of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.",
        "The woman said to him,",
        "Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.",
        "He said to her,",
        "Go call your husband and come back here.",
        "The woman replied,",
        "I have no husband. Jesus said to her,",
        "Right you are when you said, ‘I have no husband,’",
        "for you have had five husbands, and the man you are living with now is not your husband. This you said truthfully!",
        "The woman said to him,",
        "Sir, I see that you are a prophet.",
        "Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.",
        "Jesus said to her,",
        "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.",
        "You people worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.",
        "But a time is coming &#8211; and now is here &#8211; when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers.",
        "God is spirit, and the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.",
        "The woman said to him,",
        "I know that Messiah is coming (the one called Christ);",
        "whenever he comes, he will tell us everything.",
        "Jesus said to her,",
        "I, the one speaking to you, am he.",
        "Now at that very moment his disciples came back. They were shocked because he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said,",
        "What do you want? or",
        "Why are you speaking with her?",
        "Then the woman left her water jar, went off into the town and said to the people,",
        "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Surely he can’t be the Messiah, can he?",
        "So they left the town and began coming to him.",
        "Meanwhile the disciples were urging him,",
        "Rabbi, eat something.",
        "But he said to them,",
        "I have food to eat that you know nothing about.",
        "So the disciples began to say to one another,",
        "No one brought him anything to eat, did they?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to complete his work.",
        "Don’t you say, ‘There are four more months and then comes the harvest?’ I tell you, look up and see that the fields are already white for harvest!",
        "The one who reaps receives pay and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together.",
        "For in this instance the saying is true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’",
        "I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have labored and you have entered into their labor.",
        "Now many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the report of the woman who testified,",
        "He told me everything I ever did.",
        "So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them. He stayed there two days,",
        "and because of his word many more believed.",
        "They said to the woman,",
        "No longer do we believe because of your words, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this one really is the Savior of the world.",
        "After the two days he departed from there to Galilee.",
        "(For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)",
        "So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had gone to the feast).",
        "Now he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine. In Capernaum there was a certain royal official whose son was sick.",
        "When he heard that Jesus had come back from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.",
        "So Jesus said to him,",
        "Unless you people see signs and wonders you will never believe!",
        "Sir, the official said to him,",
        "come down before my child dies.",
        "Jesus told him,",
        "Go home; your son will live. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and set off for home.",
        "While he was on his way down, his slaves met him and told him that his son was going to live.",
        "So he asked them the time when his condition began to improve, and they told him,",
        "Yesterday at one o’clock in the afternoon the fever left him.",
        "Then the father realized that it was the very time Jesus had said to him,",
        "Your son will live, and he himself believed along with his entire household.",
        "Jesus did this as his second miraculous sign when he returned from Judea to Galilee.",
        "After this there was a Jewish feast, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
        "Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool called Bethzatha in Aramaic, which has five covered walkways.",
        "A great number of sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed people were lying in these walkways.",
        "[[EMPTY]]",
        "Now a man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years.",
        "When Jesus saw him lying there and when he realized that the man had been disabled a long time already, he said to him,",
        "Do you want to become well?",
        "The sick man answered him,",
        "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I am trying to get into the water, someone else goes down there before me.",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Stand up! Pick up your mat and walk.",
        "Immediately the man was healed, and he picked up his mat and started walking. (Now that day was a Sabbath.)",
        "So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed,",
        "It is the Sabbath, and you are not permitted to carry your mat.",
        "But he answered them,",
        "The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’",
        "They asked him,",
        "Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk’?",
        "But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped out, since there was a crowd in that place.",
        "After this Jesus found him at the temple and said to him,",
        "Look, you have become well. Don’t sin any more, lest anything worse happen to you.",
        "The man went away and informed the Jewish leaders that Jesus was the one who had made him well.",
        "Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began persecuting him.",
        "So he told them,",
        "My Father is working until now, and I too am working.",
        "For this reason the Jewish leaders were trying even harder to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was also calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal with God.",
        "So Jesus answered them,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, the Son can do nothing on his own initiative, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.",
        "For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does, and will show him greater deeds than these, so that you will be amazed.",
        "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes.",
        "Furthermore, the Father does not judge anyone, but has assigned all judgment to the Son,",
        "so that all people will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, the one who hears my message and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, but has crossed over from death to life.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, a time is coming &#8211; and is now here &#8211; when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.",
        "For just as the Father has life in himself, thus he has granted the Son to have life in himself,",
        "and he has granted the Son authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.",
        "Do not be amazed at this, because a time is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice",
        "and will come out &#8211; the ones who have done what is good to the resurrection resulting in life, and the ones who have done what is evil to the resurrection resulting in condemnation.",
        "I can do nothing on my own initiative. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.",
        "If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.",
        "There is another who testifies about me, and I know the testimony he testifies about me is true.",
        "You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.",
        "(I do not accept human testimony, but I say this so that you may be saved.)",
        "He was a lamp that was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice greatly for a short time in his light.",
        "But I have a testimony greater than that from John. For the deeds that the Father has assigned me to complete &#8211; the deeds I am now doing &#8211; testify about me that the Father has sent me.",
        "And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You people have never heard his voice nor seen his form at any time,",
        "nor do you have his word residing in you, because you do not believe the one whom he sent.",
        "You study the scriptures thoroughly because you think in them you possess eternal life, and it is these same scriptures that testify about me,",
        "but you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.",
        "I do not accept praise from people,",
        "but I know you, that you do not have the love of God within you.",
        "I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. If someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.",
        "How can you believe, if you accept praise from one another and don’t seek the praise that comes from the only God?",
        "Do not suppose that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have placed your hope.",
        "If you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me.",
        "But if you do not believe what Moses wrote, how will you believe my words?",
        "After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (also called the Sea of Tiberias).",
        "A large crowd was following him because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing on the sick.",
        "So Jesus went on up the mountainside and sat down there with his disciples.",
        "(Now the Jewish feast of the Passover was near.)",
        "Then Jesus, when he looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, said to Philip,",
        "Where can we buy bread so that these people may eat?",
        "(Now Jesus said this to test him, for he knew what he was going to do.)",
        "Philip replied,",
        "Two hundred silver coins worth of bread would not be enough for them, for each one to get a little.",
        "One of Jesus’ disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him,",
        "Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what good are these for so many people?",
        "Jesus said,",
        "Have the people sit down. (Now there was a lot of grass in that place.) So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.",
        "Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed the bread to those who were seated. He then did the same with the fish, as much as they wanted.",
        "When they were all satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples,",
        "Gather up the broken pieces that are left over, so that nothing is wasted.",
        "So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves left over by the people who had eaten.",
        "Now when the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus performed, they began to say to one another,",
        "This is certainly the Prophet who is to come into the world.",
        "Then Jesus, because he knew they were going to come and seize him by force to make him king, withdrew again up the mountainside alone.",
        "Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,",
        "got into a boat, and started to cross the lake to Capernaum. (It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.)",
        "By now a strong wind was blowing and the sea was getting rough.",
        "Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they caught sight of Jesus walking on the lake, approaching the boat, and they were frightened.",
        "But he said to them,",
        "It is I. Do not be afraid.",
        "Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land where they had been heading.",
        "The next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the lake realized that only one small boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.",
        "But some boats from Tiberias came to shore near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.",
        "So when the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus.",
        "When they found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him,",
        "Rabbi, when did you get here?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs, but because you ate all the loaves of bread you wanted.",
        "Do not work for the food that disappears, but for the food that remains to eternal life &#8211; the food which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has put his seal of approval on him.",
        "So then they said to him,",
        "What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "This is the deed God requires &#8211; to believe in the one whom he sent.",
        "So they said to him,",
        "Then what miraculous sign will you perform, so that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?",
        "Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’",
        "Then Jesus told them,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven.",
        "For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.",
        "So they said to him,",
        "Sir, give us this bread all the time!",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never go hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty.",
        "But I told you that you have seen me and still do not believe.",
        "Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never send away.",
        "For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me.",
        "Now this is the will of the one who sent me &#8211; that I should not lose one person of every one he has given me, but raise them all up at the last day.",
        "For this is the will of my Father &#8211; for everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him to have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.",
        "Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus began complaining about him because he said,",
        "I am the bread that came down from heaven,",
        "and they said,",
        "Isn’t this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Do not complain about me to one another.",
        "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.",
        "It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to me.",
        "(Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God &#8211; he has seen the Father.)",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, the one who believes has eternal life.",
        "I am the bread of life.",
        "Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.",
        "This is the bread that has come down from heaven, so that a person may eat from it and not die.",
        "I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread he will live forever. The bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.",
        "Then the Jews who were hostile to Jesus began to argue with one another,",
        "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves.",
        "The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.",
        "For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.",
        "The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me, and I in him.",
        "Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so the one who consumes me will live because of me.",
        "This is the bread that came down from heaven; it is not like the bread your ancestors ate, but then later died. The one who eats this bread will live forever.",
        "Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.",
        "Then many of his disciples, when they heard these things, said,",
        "This is a difficult saying! Who can understand it?",
        "When Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining about this, he said to them,",
        "Does this cause you to be offended?",
        "Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?",
        "The Spirit is the one who gives life; human nature is of no help! The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.",
        "But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus had already known from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)",
        "So Jesus added,",
        "Because of this I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has allowed him to come.",
        "After this many of his disciples quit following him and did not accompany him any longer.",
        "So Jesus said to the twelve,",
        "You don’t want to go away too, do you?",
        "Simon Peter answered him,",
        "Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.",
        "We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God!",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is the devil?",
        "(Now he said this about Judas son of Simon Iscariot, for Judas, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.)",
        "After this Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He stayed out of Judea because the Jewish leaders wanted to kill him.",
        "Now the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was near.",
        "So Jesus’ brothers advised him,",
        "Leave here and go to Judea so your disciples may see your miracles that you are performing.",
        "For no one who seeks to make a reputation for himself does anything in secret. If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.",
        "(For not even his own brothers believed in him.)",
        "So Jesus replied,",
        "My time has not yet arrived, but you are ready at any opportunity!",
        "The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it that its deeds are evil.",
        "You go up to the feast yourselves. I am not going up to this feast because my time has not yet fully arrived.",
        "When he had said this, he remained in Galilee.",
        "But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then Jesus himself also went up, not openly but in secret.",
        "So the Jewish leaders were looking for him at the feast, asking,",
        "Where is he?",
        "There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds. Some were saying,",
        "He is a good man, but others,",
        "He deceives the common people.",
        "However, no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jewish leaders.",
        "When the feast was half over, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach.",
        "Then the Jewish leaders were astonished and said,",
        "How does this man know so much when he has never had formal instruction?",
        "So Jesus replied,",
        "My teaching is not from me, but from the one who sent me.",
        "If anyone wants to do God’s will, he will know about my teaching, whether it is from God or whether I speak from my own authority.",
        "The person who speaks on his own authority desires to receive honor for himself; the one who desires the honor of the one who sent him is a man of integrity, and there is no unrighteousness in him.",
        "Hasn’t Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law! Why do you want to kill me?",
        "The crowd answered,",
        "You’re possessed by a demon! Who is trying to kill you?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "I performed one miracle and you are all amazed.",
        "However, because Moses gave you the practice of circumcision (not that it came from Moses, but from the forefathers), you circumcise a male child on the Sabbath.",
        "But if a male child is circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?",
        "Do not judge according to external appearance, but judge with proper judgment.",
        "Then some of the residents of Jerusalem began to say,",
        "Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?",
        "Yet here he is, speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to him. Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ?",
        "But we know where this man comes from. Whenever the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.",
        "Then Jesus, while teaching in the temple courts, cried out,",
        "You both know me and know where I come from! And I have not come on my own initiative, but the one who sent me is true. You do not know him,",
        "but I know him, because I have come from him and he sent me.",
        "So then they tried to seize Jesus, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.",
        "Yet many of the crowd believed in him and said,",
        "Whenever the Christ comes, he won’t perform more miraculous signs than this man did, will he?",
        "The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Jesus, so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.",
        "Then Jesus said,",
        "I will be with you for only a little while longer, and then I am going to the one who sent me.",
        "You will look for me but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come.",
        "Then the Jewish leaders said to one another,",
        "Where is he going to go that we cannot find him? He is not going to go to the Jewish people dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?",
        "What did he mean by saying, ‘You will look for me but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come’?",
        "On the last day of the feast, the greatest day, Jesus stood up and shouted out,",
        "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and",
        "let the one who believes in me drink. Just as the scripture says, ‘From within him will flow rivers of living water.’",
        "(Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were going to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)",
        "When they heard these words, some of the crowd began to say,",
        "This really is the Prophet!",
        "Others said,",
        "This is the Christ! But still others said,",
        "No, for the Christ doesn’t come from Galilee, does he?",
        "Don’t the scriptures say that the Christ is a descendant of David and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?",
        "So there was a division in the crowd because of Jesus.",
        "Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.",
        "Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them,",
        "Why didn’t you bring him back with you?",
        "The officers replied,",
        "No one ever spoke like this man!",
        "Then the Pharisees answered,",
        "You haven’t been deceived too, have you?",
        "None of the rulers or the Pharisees have believed in him, have they?",
        "But this rabble who do not know the law are accursed!",
        "Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before and who was one of the rulers, said,",
        "Our law doesn’t condemn a man unless it first hears from him and learns what he is doing, does it?",
        "They replied,",
        "You aren’t from Galilee too, are you? Investigate carefully and you will see that no prophet comes from Galilee!",
        "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.",
        "Early in the morning he came to the temple courts again. All the people came to him, and he sat down and began to teach them.",
        "The experts in the law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught committing adultery. They made her stand in front of them",
        "and said to Jesus,",
        "Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of adultery.",
        "In the law Moses commanded us to stone to death such women. What then do you say?",
        "(Now they were asking this in an attempt to trap him, so that they could bring charges against him.) Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.",
        "When they persisted in asking him, he stood up straight and replied,",
        "Whoever among you is guiltless may be the first to throw a stone at her.",
        "Then he bent over again and wrote on the ground.",
        "Now when they heard this, they began to drift away one at a time, starting with the older ones, until Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.",
        "Jesus stood up straight and said to her,",
        "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?",
        "She replied,",
        "No one, Lord. And Jesus said,",
        "I do not condemn you either. Go, and from now on do not sin any more.]]",
        "Then Jesus spoke out again,",
        "I am the light of the world. The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.",
        "So the Pharisees objected,",
        "You testify about yourself; your testimony is not true!",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you people do not know where I came from or where I am going.",
        "You people judge by outward appearances; I do not judge anyone.",
        "But if I judge, my evaluation is accurate, because I am not alone when I judge, but I and the Father who sent me do so together.",
        "It is written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.",
        "I testify about myself and the Father who sent me testifies about me.",
        "Then they began asking him,",
        "Who is your father? Jesus answered,",
        "You do not know either me or my Father. If you knew me you would know my Father too.",
        "(Jesus spoke these words near the offering box while he was teaching in the temple courts. No one seized him because his time had not yet come.)",
        "Then Jesus said to them again,",
        "I am going away, and you will look for me but will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come.",
        "So the Jewish leaders began to say,",
        "Perhaps he is going to kill himself, because he says, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "You people are from below; I am from above. You people are from this world; I am not from this world.",
        "Thus I told you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.",
        "So they said to him,",
        "Who are you? Jesus replied,",
        "What I have told you from the beginning.",
        "I have many things to say and to judge about you, but the Father who sent me is truthful, and the things I have heard from him I speak to the world.",
        "(They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.)",
        "Then Jesus said,",
        "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing on my own initiative, but I speak just what the Father taught me.",
        "And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do those things that please him.",
        "While he was saying these things, many people believed in him.",
        "Then Jesus said to those Judeans who had believed him,",
        "If you continue to follow my teaching, you are really my disciples",
        "and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.",
        "We are descendants of Abraham, they replied,",
        "and have never been anyone’s slaves! How can you say, ‘You will become free’?",
        "Jesus answered them,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, everyone who practices sin is a slave of sin.",
        "The slave does not remain in the family forever, but the son remains forever.",
        "So if the son sets you free, you will be really free.",
        "I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. But you want to kill me, because my teaching makes no progress among you.",
        "I am telling you the things I have seen while with the Father; as for you, practice the things you have heard from the Father!",
        "They answered him,",
        "Abraham is our father! Jesus replied,",
        "If you are Abraham’s children, you would be doing the deeds of Abraham.",
        "But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth I heard from God. Abraham did not do this!",
        "You people are doing the deeds of your father. Then they said to Jesus,",
        "We were not born as a result of immorality! We have only one Father, God himself.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come from God and am now here. I have not come on my own initiative, but he sent me.",
        "Why don’t you understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot accept my teaching.",
        "You people are from your father the devil, and you want to do what your father desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies.",
        "But because I am telling you the truth, you do not believe me.",
        "Who among you can prove me guilty of any sin? If I am telling you the truth, why don’t you believe me?",
        "The one who belongs to God listens and responds to God’s words. You don’t listen and respond, because you don’t belong to God.",
        "The Judeans replied,",
        "Aren’t we correct in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "I am not possessed by a demon, but I honor my Father &#8211; and yet you dishonor me.",
        "I am not trying to get praise for myself. There is one who demands it, and he also judges.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, if anyone obeys my teaching, he will never see death.",
        "Then the Judeans responded,",
        "Now we know you’re possessed by a demon! Both Abraham and the prophets died, and yet you say, ‘If anyone obeys my teaching, he will never experience death.’",
        "You aren’t greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? And the prophets died too! Who do you claim to be?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "If I glorify myself, my glory is worthless. The one who glorifies me is my Father, about whom you people say, ‘He is our God.’",
        "Yet you do not know him, but I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him, and I obey his teaching.",
        "Your father Abraham was overjoyed to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.",
        "Then the Judeans replied,",
        "You are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham?",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, before Abraham came into existence, I am!",
        "Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out from the temple area.",
        "Now as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man who had been blind from birth.",
        "His disciples asked him,",
        "Rabbi, who committed the sin that caused him to be born blind, this man or his parents?",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but he was born blind so that the acts of God may be revealed through what happens to him.",
        "We must perform the deeds of the one who sent me as long as it is daytime. Night is coming when no one can work.",
        "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.",
        "Having said this, he spat on the ground and made some mud with the saliva. He smeared the mud on the blind man’s eyes",
        "and said to him,",
        "Go wash in the pool of Siloam (which is translated",
        "sent). So the blind man went away and washed, and came back seeing.",
        "Then the neighbors and the people who had seen him previously as a beggar began saying,",
        "Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?",
        "Some people said,",
        "This is the man! while others said,",
        "No, but he looks like him. The man himself kept insisting,",
        "I am the one!",
        "So they asked him,",
        "How then were you made to see?",
        "He replied,",
        "The man called Jesus made mud, smeared it on my eyes and told me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So I went and washed, and was able to see.",
        "They said to him,",
        "Where is that man? He replied,",
        "I don’t know.",
        "They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.",
        "(Now the day on which Jesus made the mud and caused him to see was a Sabbath.)",
        "So the Pharisees asked him again how he had gained his sight. He replied,",
        "He put mud on my eyes and I washed, and now I am able to see.",
        "Then some of the Pharisees began to say,",
        "This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath. But others said,",
        "How can a man who is a sinner perform such miraculous signs? Thus there was a division among them.",
        "So again they asked the man who used to be blind,",
        "What do you say about him, since he caused you to see?",
        "He is a prophet, the man replied.",
        "Now the Jewish religious leaders refused to believe that he had really been blind and had gained his sight until at last they summoned the parents of the man who had become able to see.",
        "They asked the parents,",
        "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?",
        "So his parents replied,",
        "We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.",
        "But we do not know how he is now able to see, nor do we know who caused him to see. Ask him, he is a mature adult. He will speak for himself.",
        "(His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders. For the Jewish leaders had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.",
        "For this reason his parents said,",
        "He is a mature adult, ask him.)",
        "Then they summoned the man who used to be blind a second time and said to him,",
        "Promise before God to tell the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.",
        "He replied,",
        "I do not know whether he is a sinner. I do know one thing &#8211; that although I was blind, now I can see.",
        "Then they said to him,",
        "What did he do to you? How did he cause you to see?",
        "He answered,",
        "I told you already and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You people don’t want to become his disciples too, do you?",
        "They heaped insults on him, saying,",
        "You are his disciple! We are disciples of Moses!",
        "We know that God has spoken to Moses! We do not know where this man comes from!",
        "The man replied,",
        "This is a remarkable thing, that you don’t know where he comes from, and yet he caused me to see!",
        "We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is devout and does his will, God listens to him.",
        "Never before has anyone heard of someone causing a man born blind to see.",
        "If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.",
        "They replied,",
        "You were born completely in sinfulness, and yet you presume to teach us? So they threw him out.",
        "Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, so he found the man and said to him,",
        "Do you believe in the Son of Man?",
        "The man replied,",
        "And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?",
        "Jesus told him,",
        "You have seen him; he is the one speaking with you.",
        "[He said,",
        "Lord, I believe, and he worshiped him.",
        "Jesus said,]",
        "For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may gain their sight, and the ones who see may become blind.",
        "Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked him,",
        "We are not blind too, are we?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin, but now because you claim that you can see, your guilt remains.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.",
        "The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.",
        "The doorkeeper opens the door for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.",
        "When he has brought all his own sheep out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.",
        "They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, because they do not recognize the stranger’s voice.",
        "Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.",
        "So Jesus said to them again,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, I am the door for the sheep.",
        "All who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.",
        "I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out, and find pasture.",
        "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.",
        "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.",
        "The hired hand, who is not a shepherd and does not own sheep, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and runs away. So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them.",
        "Because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep, he runs away.",
        "I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me &#8211;",
        "just as the Father knows me and I know the Father &#8211; and I lay down my life for the sheep.",
        "I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, so that there will be one flock and one shepherd.",
        "This is why the Father loves me &#8211; because I lay down my life, so that I may take it back again.",
        "No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This commandment I received from my Father.",
        "Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people because of these words.",
        "Many of them were saying,",
        "He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind! Why do you listen to him?",
        "Others said,",
        "These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon. A demon cannot cause the blind to see, can it?",
        "Then came the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem.",
        "It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico.",
        "The Jewish leaders surrounded him and asked,",
        "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "I told you and you do not believe. The deeds I do in my Father’s name testify about me.",
        "But you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep.",
        "My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.",
        "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; no one will snatch them from my hand.",
        "My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand.",
        "The Father and I are one.",
        "The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death.",
        "Jesus said to them,",
        "I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?",
        "The Jewish leaders replied,",
        "We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God.",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’?",
        "If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ (and the scripture cannot be broken),",
        "do you say about the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?",
        "If I do not perform the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.",
        "But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may come to know and understand that I am in the Father and the Father is in me.",
        "Then they attempted again to seize him, but he escaped their clutches.",
        "Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John had been baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there.",
        "Many came to him and began to say,",
        "John performed no miraculous sign, but everything John said about this man was true!",
        "And many believed in Jesus there.",
        "Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived.",
        "(Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)",
        "So the sisters sent a message to Jesus,",
        "Lord, look, the one you love is sick.",
        "When Jesus heard this, he said,",
        "This sickness will not lead to death, but to God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.",
        "(Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)",
        "So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he remained in the place where he was for two more days.",
        "Then after this, he said to his disciples,",
        "Let us go to Judea again.",
        "The disciples replied,",
        "Rabbi, the Jewish leaders were just now trying to stone you to death! Are you going there again?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Are there not twelve hours in a day? If anyone walks around in the daytime, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.",
        "But if anyone walks around at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.",
        "After he said this, he added,",
        "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep. But I am going there to awaken him.",
        "Then the disciples replied,",
        "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.",
        "(Now Jesus had been talking about his death, but they thought he had been talking about real sleep.)",
        "Then Jesus told them plainly,",
        "Lazarus has died,",
        "and I am glad for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.",
        "So Thomas (called Didymus) said to his fellow disciples,",
        "Let us go too, so that we may die with him.",
        "When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days already.",
        "(Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,",
        "so many of the Jewish people of the region had come to Martha and Mary to console them over the loss of their brother.)",
        "So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.",
        "Martha said to Jesus,",
        "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.",
        "But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will grant you.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Your brother will come back to life again.",
        "Martha said,",
        "I know that he will come back to life again in the resurrection at the last day.",
        "Jesus said to her,",
        "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live even if he dies,",
        "and the one who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?",
        "She replied,",
        "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.",
        "And when she had said this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, saying privately,",
        "The Teacher is here and is asking for you.",
        "So when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.",
        "(Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still in the place where Martha had come out to meet him.)",
        "Then the people who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out. They followed her, because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there.",
        "Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him,",
        "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.",
        "When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping, he was intensely moved in spirit and greatly distressed.",
        "He asked,",
        "Where have you laid him? They replied,",
        "Lord, come and see.",
        "Jesus wept.",
        "Thus the people who had come to mourn said,",
        "Look how much he loved him!",
        "But some of them said,",
        "This is the man who caused the blind man to see! Couldn’t he have done something to keep Lazarus from dying?",
        "Jesus, intensely moved again, came to the tomb. (Now it was a cave, and a stone was placed across it.)",
        "Jesus said,",
        "Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, replied,",
        "Lord, by this time the body will have a bad smell, because he has been buried four days.",
        "Jesus responded,",
        "Didn’t I tell you that if you believe, you would see the glory of God?",
        "So they took away the stone. Jesus looked upward and said,",
        "Father, I thank you that you have listened to me.",
        "I knew that you always listen to me, but I said this for the sake of the crowd standing around here, that they may believe that you sent me.",
        "When he had said this, he shouted in a loud voice,",
        "Lazarus, come out!",
        "The one who had died came out, his feet and hands tied up with strips of cloth, and a cloth wrapped around his face. Jesus said to them,",
        "Unwrap him and let him go.",
        "Then many of the people, who had come with Mary and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in him.",
        "But some of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done.",
        "So the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said,",
        "What are we doing? For this man is performing many miraculous signs.",
        "If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our sanctuary and our nation.",
        "Then one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said,",
        "You know nothing at all!",
        "You do not realize that it is more to your advantage to have one man die for the people than for the whole nation to perish.",
        "(Now he did not say this on his own, but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish nation,",
        "and not for the Jewish nation only, but to gather together into one the children of God who are scattered.)",
        "So from that day they planned together to kill him.",
        "Thus Jesus no longer went around publicly among the Judeans, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.",
        "Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, and many people went up to Jerusalem from the rural areas before the Passover to cleanse themselves ritually.",
        "Thus they were looking for Jesus, and saying to one another as they stood in the temple courts,",
        "What do you think? That he won’t come to the feast?",
        "(Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it, so that they could arrest him.)",
        "Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom he had raised from the dead.",
        "So they prepared a dinner for Jesus there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was among those present at the table with him.",
        "Then Mary took three quarters of a pound of expensive aromatic oil from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus. She then wiped his feet dry with her hair. (Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil.)",
        "But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said,",
        "Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor?",
        "(Now Judas said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.)",
        "So Jesus said,",
        "Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of my burial.",
        "For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!",
        "Now a large crowd of Judeans learned that Jesus was there, and so they came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.",
        "So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too,",
        "for on account of him many of the Jewish people from Jerusalem were going away and believing in Jesus.",
        "The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.",
        "So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. They began to shout,",
        "Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!",
        "Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,",
        "Do not be afraid, people of Zion; look, your king is coming, seated on a donkey’s colt!",
        "(His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him and that these things had happened to him.)",
        "So the crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify about it.",
        "Because they had heard that Jesus had performed this miraculous sign, the crowd went out to meet him.",
        "Thus the Pharisees said to one another,",
        "You see that you can do nothing. Look, the world has run off after him!",
        "Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up to worship at the feast.",
        "So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested,",
        "Sir, we would like to see Jesus.",
        "Philip went and told Andrew, and they both went and told Jesus.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it produces much grain.",
        "The one who loves his life destroys it, and the one who hates his life in this world guards it for eternal life.",
        "If anyone wants to serve me, he must follow me, and where I am, my servant will be too. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.",
        "Now my soul is greatly distressed. And what should I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? No, but for this very reason I have come to this hour.",
        "Father, glorify your name. Then a voice came from heaven,",
        "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.",
        "The crowd that stood there and heard the voice said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to him.",
        "Jesus said,",
        "This voice has not come for my benefit but for yours.",
        "Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out.",
        "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.",
        "(Now he said this to indicate clearly what kind of death he was going to die.)",
        "Then the crowd responded,",
        "We have heard from the law that the Christ will remain forever. How can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "The light is with you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.",
        "While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light. When Jesus had said these things, he went away and hid himself from them.",
        "Although Jesus had performed so many miraculous signs before them, they still refused to believe in him,",
        "so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled. He said,",
        "Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?",
        "For this reason they could not believe, because again Isaiah said,",
        "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and turn to me, and I would heal them.",
        "Isaiah said these things because he saw Christ’s glory, and spoke about him.",
        "Nevertheless, even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess Jesus to be the Christ, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.",
        "For they loved praise from men more than praise from God.",
        "But Jesus shouted out,",
        "The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me,",
        "and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me.",
        "I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness.",
        "If anyone hears my words and does not obey them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.",
        "The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge; the word I have spoken will judge him at the last day.",
        "For I have not spoken from my own authority, but the Father himself who sent me has commanded me what I should say and what I should speak.",
        "And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Thus the things I say, I say just as the Father has told me.",
        "Just before the Passover feast, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now loved them to the very end.",
        "The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray Jesus.",
        "Because Jesus knew that the Father had handed all things over to him, and that he had come from God and was going back to God,",
        "he got up from the meal, removed his outer clothes, took a towel and tied it around himself.",
        "He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself.",
        "Then he came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him,",
        "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "You do not understand what I am doing now, but you will understand after these things.",
        "Peter said to him,",
        "You will never wash my feet! Jesus replied,",
        "If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.",
        "Simon Peter said to him,",
        "Lord, wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you disciples are clean, but not every one of you.",
        "(For Jesus knew the one who was going to betray him. For this reason he said,",
        "Not every one of you is clean.)",
        "So when Jesus had washed their feet and put his outer clothing back on, he took his place at the table again and said to them,",
        "Do you understand what I have done for you?",
        "You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and do so correctly, for that is what I am.",
        "If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too ought to wash one another’s feet.",
        "For I have given you an example &#8211; you should do just as I have done for you.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, the slave is not greater than his master, nor is the one who is sent as a messenger greater than the one who sent him.",
        "If you understand these things, you will be blessed if you do them.",
        "What I am saying does not refer to all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture, ‘The one who eats my bread has turned against me.’",
        "I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe that I am he.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, whoever accepts the one I send accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.",
        "When he had said these things, Jesus was greatly distressed in spirit, and testified,",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, one of you will betray me.",
        "The disciples began to look at one another, worried and perplexed to know which of them he was talking about.",
        "One of his disciples, the one Jesus loved, was at the table to the right of Jesus in a place of honor.",
        "So Simon Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to.",
        "Then the disciple whom Jesus loved leaned back against Jesus’ chest and asked him,",
        "Lord, who is it?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish. Then he dipped the piece of bread in the dish and gave it to Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son.",
        "And after Judas took the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him,",
        "What you are about to do, do quickly.",
        "(Now none of those present at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas.",
        "Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor.)",
        "Judas took the piece of bread and went out immediately. (Now it was night.)",
        "When Judas had gone out, Jesus said,",
        "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.",
        "If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him right away.",
        "Children, I am still with you for a little while. You will look for me, and just as I said to the Jewish religious leaders, ‘Where I am going you cannot come,’ now I tell you the same.",
        "I give you a new commandment &#8211; to love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.",
        "Everyone will know by this that you are my disciples &#8211; if you have love for one another.",
        "Simon Peter said to him,",
        "Lord, where are you going? Jesus replied,",
        "Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.",
        "Peter said to him,",
        "Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!",
        "Jesus answered,",
        "Will you lay down your life for me? I tell you the solemn truth, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times!",
        "Do not let your hearts be distressed. You believe in God; believe also in me.",
        "There are many dwelling places in my Father’s house. Otherwise, I would have told you, because I am going away to make ready a place for you.",
        "And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will come again and take you to be with me, so that where I am you may be too.",
        "And you know the way where I am going.",
        "Thomas said,",
        "Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.",
        "If you have known me, you will know my Father too. And from now on you do know him and have seen him.",
        "Philip said,",
        "Lord, show us the Father, and we will be content.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Have I been with you for so long, and you have not known me, Philip? The person who has seen me has seen the Father! How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?",
        "Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own initiative, but the Father residing in me performs his miraculous deeds.",
        "Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, but if you do not believe me, believe because of the miraculous deeds themselves.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing, and will perform greater deeds than these, because I am going to the Father.",
        "And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.",
        "If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.",
        "If you love me, you will obey my commandments.",
        "Then I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you forever &#8211;",
        "the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept, because it does not see him or know him. But you know him, because he resides with you and will be in you.",
        "I will not abandon you as orphans, I will come to you.",
        "In a little while the world will not see me any longer, but you will see me; because I live, you will live too.",
        "You will know at that time that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you.",
        "The person who has my commandments and obeys them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal myself to him.",
        "Lord, Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said,",
        "what has happened that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "If anyone loves me, he will obey my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and take up residence with him.",
        "The person who does not love me does not obey my words. And the word you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.",
        "I have spoken these things while staying with you.",
        "But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and will cause you to remember everything I said to you.",
        "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; I do not give it to you as the world does. Do not let your hearts be distressed or lacking in courage.",
        "You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.",
        "I have told you now before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe.",
        "I will not speak with you much longer, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me,",
        "but I am doing just what the Father commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Get up, let us go from here.",
        "I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener.",
        "He takes away every branch that does not bear fruit in me. He prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit.",
        "You are clean already because of the word that I have spoken to you.",
        "Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.",
        "I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me &#8211; and I in him &#8211; bears much fruit, because apart from me you can accomplish nothing.",
        "If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out like a branch, and dries up; and such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire, and are burned up.",
        "If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you want, and it will be done for you.",
        "My Father is honored by this, that you bear much fruit and show that you are my disciples.",
        "Just as the Father has loved me, I have also loved you; remain in my love.",
        "If you obey my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father’s commandments and remain in his love.",
        "I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be complete.",
        "My commandment is this &#8211; to love one another just as I have loved you.",
        "No one has greater love than this &#8211; that one lays down his life for his friends.",
        "You are my friends if you do what I command you.",
        "I no longer call you slaves, because the slave does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have revealed to you everything I heard from my Father.",
        "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that remains, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.",
        "This I command you &#8211; to love one another.",
        "If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me first.",
        "If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. However, because you do not belong to the world, but I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you.",
        "Remember what I told you, ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they obeyed my word, they will obey yours too.",
        "But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.",
        "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. But they no longer have any excuse for their sin.",
        "The one who hates me hates my Father too.",
        "If I had not performed among them the miraculous deeds that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen the deeds and have hated both me and my Father.",
        "Now this happened to fulfill the word that is written in their law, ‘They hated me without reason.’",
        "When the Advocate comes, whom I will send you from the Father &#8211; the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father &#8211; he will testify about me,",
        "and you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.",
        "I have told you all these things so that you will not fall away.",
        "They will put you out of the synagogue, yet a time is coming when the one who kills you will think he is offering service to God.",
        "They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me.",
        "But I have told you these things so that when their time comes, you will remember that I told you about them.",
        "I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you.",
        "But now I am going to the one who sent me, and not one of you is asking me, ‘Where are you going?’",
        "Instead your hearts are filled with sadness because I have said these things to you.",
        "But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you.",
        "And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment &#8211;",
        "concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;",
        "concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer;",
        "and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.",
        "I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.",
        "But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. For he will not speak on his own authority, but will speak whatever he hears, and will tell you what is to come.",
        "He will glorify me, because he will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you.",
        "Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you.",
        "In a little while you will see me no longer; again after a little while, you will see me.",
        "Then some of his disciples said to one another,",
        "What is the meaning of what he is saying, ‘In a little while you will not see me; again after a little while, you will see me,’ and, ‘because I am going to the Father’?",
        "So they kept on repeating,",
        "What is the meaning of what he says, ‘In a little while’? We do not understand what he is talking about.",
        "Jesus could see that they wanted to ask him about these things, so he said to them,",
        "Are you asking each other about this &#8211; that I said, ‘In a little while you will not see me; again after a little while, you will see me’?",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, you will weep and wail, but the world will rejoice; you will be sad, but your sadness will turn into joy.",
        "When a woman gives birth, she has distress because her time has come, but when her child is born, she no longer remembers the suffering because of her joy that a human being has been born into the world.",
        "So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.",
        "At that time you will ask me nothing. I tell you the solemn truth, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.",
        "Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive it, so that your joy may be complete.",
        "I have told you these things in obscure figures of speech; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in obscure figures, but will tell you plainly about the Father.",
        "At that time you will ask in my name, and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.",
        "For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.",
        "I came from the Father and entered into the world, but in turn, I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.",
        "His disciples said,",
        "Look, now you are speaking plainly and not in obscure figures of speech!",
        "Now we know that you know everything and do not need anyone to ask you anything. Because of this we believe that you have come from God.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Do you now believe?",
        "Look, a time is coming &#8211; and has come &#8211; when you will be scattered, each one to his own home, and I will be left alone. Yet I am not alone, because my Father is with me.",
        "I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble and suffering, but take courage &#8211; I have conquered the world.",
        "When Jesus had finished saying these things, he looked upward to heaven and said,",
        "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, so that your Son may glorify you &#8211;",
        "just as you have given him authority over all humanity, so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him.",
        "Now this is eternal life &#8211; that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent.",
        "I glorified you on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.",
        "And now, Father, glorify me at your side with the glory I had with you before the world was created.",
        "I have revealed your name to the men you gave me out of the world. They belonged to you, and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your word.",
        "Now they understand that everything you have given me comes from you,",
        "because I have given them the words you have given me. They accepted them and really understand that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.",
        "I am praying on behalf of them. I am not praying on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those you have given me, because they belong to you.",
        "Everything I have belongs to you, and everything you have belongs to me, and I have been glorified by them.",
        "I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them safe in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one just as we are one.",
        "When I was with them I kept them safe and watched over them in your name that you have given me. Not one of them was lost except the one destined for destruction, so that the scripture could be fulfilled.",
        "But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world, so they may experience my joy completed in themselves.",
        "I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.",
        "I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but that you keep them safe from the evil one.",
        "They do not belong to the world just as I do not belong to the world.",
        "Set them apart in the truth; your word is truth.",
        "Just as you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world.",
        "And I set myself apart on their behalf, so that they too may be truly set apart.",
        "I am not praying only on their behalf, but also on behalf of those who believe in me through their testimony,",
        "that they will all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you. I pray that they will be in us, so that the world will believe that you sent me.",
        "The glory you gave to me I have given to them, that they may be one just as we are one &#8211;",
        "I in them and you in me &#8211; that they may be completely one, so that the world will know that you sent me, and you have loved them just as you have loved me.",
        "Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, so that they can see my glory that you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world.",
        "Righteous Father, even if the world does not know you, I know you, and these men know that you sent me.",
        "I made known your name to them, and I will continue to make it known, so that the love you have loved me with may be in them, and I may be in them.",
        "When he had said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley. There was an orchard there, and he and his disciples went into it.",
        "(Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, knew the place too, because Jesus had met there many times with his disciples.)",
        "So Judas obtained a squad of soldiers and some officers of the chief priests and Pharisees. They came to the orchard with lanterns and torches and weapons.",
        "Then Jesus, because he knew everything that was going to happen to him, came and asked them,",
        "Who are you looking for?",
        "They replied,",
        "Jesus the Nazarene. He told them,",
        "I am he. (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, was standing there with them.)",
        "So when Jesus said to them,",
        "I am he, they retreated and fell to the ground.",
        "Then Jesus asked them again,",
        "Who are you looking for? And they said,",
        "Jesus the Nazarene.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.",
        "He said this to fulfill the word he had spoken,",
        "I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me.",
        "Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear. (Now the slave’s name was Malchus.)",
        "But Jesus said to Peter,",
        "Put your sword back into its sheath! Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?",
        "Then the squad of soldiers with their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up.",
        "They brought him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.",
        "(Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was to their advantage that one man die for the people.)",
        "Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas. (Now the other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, and he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard.)",
        "But Simon Peter was left standing outside by the door. So the other disciple who was acquainted with the high priest came out and spoke to the slave girl who watched the door, and brought Peter inside.",
        "The girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter,",
        "You’re not one of this man’s disciples too, are you? He replied,",
        "I am not.",
        "(Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire they had made, warming themselves because it was cold. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.)",
        "While this was happening, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "I have spoken publicly to the world. I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple courts, where all the Jewish people assemble together. I have said nothing in secret.",
        "Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said. They know what I said.",
        "When Jesus had said this, one of the high priest’s officers who stood nearby struck him on the face and said,",
        "Is that the way you answer the high priest?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "If I have said something wrong, confirm what is wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why strike me?",
        "Then Annas sent him, still tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.",
        "Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing in the courtyard warming himself. They said to him,",
        "You aren’t one of his disciples too, are you? Peter denied it:",
        "I am not!",
        "One of the high priest’s slaves, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said,",
        "Did I not see you in the orchard with him?",
        "Then Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.",
        "Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s residence. (Now it was very early morning.) They did not go into the governor’s residence so they would not be ceremonially defiled, but could eat the Passover meal.",
        "So Pilate came outside to them and said,",
        "What accusation do you bring against this man?",
        "They replied,",
        "If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.",
        "Pilate told them,",
        "Take him yourselves and pass judgment on him according to your own law! The Jewish leaders replied,",
        "We cannot legally put anyone to death.",
        "(This happened to fulfill the word Jesus had spoken when he indicated what kind of death he was going to die.)",
        "So Pilate went back into the governor’s residence, summoned Jesus, and asked him,",
        "Are you the king of the Jews?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Are you saying this on your own initiative, or have others told you about me?",
        "Pilate answered,",
        "I am not a Jew, am I? Your own people and your chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my servants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish authorities. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.",
        "Then Pilate said,",
        "So you are a king! Jesus replied,",
        "You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world &#8211; to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.",
        "Pilate asked,",
        "What is truth? When he had said this he went back outside to the Jewish leaders and announced,",
        "I find no basis for an accusation against him.",
        "But it is your custom that I release one prisoner for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?",
        "Then they shouted back,",
        "Not this man, but Barabbas! (Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.)",
        "Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged severely.",
        "The soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe.",
        "They came up to him again and again and said,",
        "Hail, king of the Jews! And they struck him repeatedly in the face.",
        "Again Pilate went out and said to the Jewish leaders,",
        "Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no reason for an accusation against him.",
        "So Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them,",
        "Look, here is the man!",
        "When the chief priests and their officers saw him, they shouted out,",
        "Crucify him! Crucify him! Pilate said,",
        "You take him and crucify him! Certainly I find no reason for an accusation against him!",
        "The Jewish leaders replied,",
        "We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he claimed to be the Son of God!",
        "When Pilate heard what they said, he was more afraid than ever,",
        "and he went back into the governor’s residence and said to Jesus,",
        "Where do you come from? But Jesus gave him no answer.",
        "So Pilate said,",
        "Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know I have the authority to release you, and to crucify you?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "You would have no authority over me at all, unless it was given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of greater sin.",
        "From this point on, Pilate tried to release him. But the Jewish leaders shouted out,",
        "If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar! Everyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar!",
        "When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in the place called",
        "The Stone Pavement (Gabbatha in Aramaic).",
        "(Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover, about noon.) Pilate said to the Jewish leaders,",
        "Look, here is your king!",
        "Then they shouted out,",
        "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! Pilate asked,",
        "Shall I crucify your king? The high priests replied,",
        "We have no king except Caesar!",
        "Then Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.So they took Jesus,",
        "and carrying his own cross he went out to the place called",
        "The Place of the Skull (called in Aramaic Golgotha).",
        "There they crucified him along with two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.",
        "Pilate also had a notice written and fastened to the cross, which read:",
        "Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.",
        "Thus many of the Jewish residents of Jerusalem read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek.",
        "Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate,",
        "Do not write, ‘The king of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am king of the Jews.’",
        "Pilate answered,",
        "What I have written, I have written.",
        "Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and made four shares, one for each soldier, and the tunic remained. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from top to bottom as a single piece.)",
        "So the soldiers said to one another,",
        "Let’s not tear it, but throw dice to see who will get it. This took place to fulfill the scripture that says,",
        "They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they threw dice. So the soldiers did these things.",
        "Now standing beside Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.",
        "So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother,",
        "Woman, look, here is your son!",
        "He then said to his disciple,",
        "Look, here is your mother! From that very time the disciple took her into his own home.",
        "After this Jesus, realizing that by this time everything was completed, said (in order to fulfill the scripture),",
        "I am thirsty!",
        "A jar full of sour wine was there, so they put a sponge soaked in sour wine on a branch of hyssop and lifted it to his mouth.",
        "When he had received the sour wine, Jesus said,",
        "It is completed! Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.",
        "Then, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies should not stay on the crosses on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an especially important one), the Jewish leaders asked Pilate to have the victims’ legs broken and the bodies taken down.",
        "So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who had been crucified with Jesus, first the one and then the other.",
        "But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.",
        "But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water flowed out immediately.",
        "And the person who saw it has testified (and his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth), so that you also may believe.",
        "For these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled,",
        "Not a bone of his will be broken.",
        "And again another scripture says,",
        "They will look on the one whom they have pierced.",
        "After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus (but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders), asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he went and took the body away.",
        "Nicodemus, the man who had previously come to Jesus at night, accompanied Joseph, carrying a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about seventy-five pounds.",
        "Then they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it, with the aromatic spices, in strips of linen cloth according to Jewish burial customs.",
        "Now at the place where Jesus was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden was a new tomb where no one had yet been buried.",
        "And so, because it was the Jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus’ body there.",
        "Now very early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved away from the entrance.",
        "So she went running to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told them,",
        "They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!",
        "Then Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb.",
        "The two were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first.",
        "He bent down and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, but he did not go in.",
        "Then Simon Peter, who had been following him, arrived and went right into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen cloth lying there,",
        "and the face cloth, which had been around Jesus’ head, not lying with the strips of linen cloth but rolled up in a place by itself.",
        "Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, came in, and he saw and believed.",
        "(For they did not yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead.)",
        "So the disciples went back to their homes.",
        "But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she bent down and looked into the tomb.",
        "And she saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’ body had been lying, one at the head and one at the feet.",
        "They said to her,",
        "Woman, why are you weeping? Mary replied,",
        "They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have put him!",
        "When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.",
        "Jesus said to her,",
        "Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for? Because she thought he was the gardener, she said to him,",
        "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.",
        "Jesus said to her,",
        "Mary. She turned and said to him in Aramaic,",
        "Rabboni (which means Teacher).",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. Go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’",
        "Mary Magdalene came and informed the disciples,",
        "I have seen the Lord! And she told them what Jesus had said to her.",
        "On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the disciples had gathered together and locked the doors of the place because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus came and stood among them and said to them,",
        "Peace be with you.",
        "When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.",
        "So Jesus said to them again,",
        "Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, I also send you.",
        "And after he said this, he breathed on them and said,",
        "Receive the Holy Spirit.",
        "If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone’s sins, they are retained.",
        "Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.",
        "The other disciples told him,",
        "We have seen the Lord! But he replied,",
        "Unless I see the wounds from the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the wounds from the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it!",
        "Eight days later the disciples were again together in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,",
        "Peace be with you!",
        "Then he said to Thomas,",
        "Put your finger here, and examine my hands. Extend your hand and put it into my side. Do not continue in your unbelief, but believe.",
        "Thomas replied to him,",
        "My Lord and my God!",
        "Jesus said to him,",
        "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are the people who have not seen and yet have believed.",
        "Now Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book.",
        "But these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.",
        "After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. Now this is how he did so.",
        "Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael (who was from Cana in Galilee), the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of his were together.",
        "Simon Peter told them,",
        "I am going fishing.",
        "We will go with you, they replied. They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.",
        "When it was already very early morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.",
        "So Jesus said to them,",
        "Children, you don’t have any fish, do you? They replied,",
        "No.",
        "He told them,",
        "Throw your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. So they threw the net, and were not able to pull it in because of the large number of fish.",
        "Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter,",
        "It is the Lord! So Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, tucked in his outer garment (for he had nothing on underneath it), and plunged into the sea.",
        "Meanwhile the other disciples came with the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards.",
        "When they got out on the beach, they saw a charcoal fire ready with a fish placed on it, and bread.",
        "Jesus said,",
        "Bring some of the fish you have just now caught.",
        "So Simon Peter went aboard and pulled the net to shore. It was full of large fish, one hundred fifty-three, but although there were so many, the net was not torn.",
        "Come, have breakfast, Jesus said. But none of the disciples dared to ask him,",
        "Who are you? because they knew it was the Lord.",
        "Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.",
        "This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.",
        "Then when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,",
        "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these do? He replied,",
        "Yes, Lord, you know I love you. Jesus told him,",
        "Feed my lambs.",
        "Jesus said a second time,",
        "Simon, son of John, do you love me? He replied,",
        "Yes, Lord, you know I love you. Jesus told him,",
        "Shepherd my sheep.",
        "Jesus said a third time,",
        "Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter was distressed that Jesus asked him a third time,",
        "Do you love me? and said,",
        "Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you. Jesus replied,",
        "Feed my sheep.",
        "I tell you the solemn truth, when you were young, you tied your clothes around you and went wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and others will tie you up and bring you where you do not want to go.",
        "(Now Jesus said this to indicate clearly by what kind of death Peter was going to glorify God.) After he said this, Jesus told Peter,",
        "Follow me.",
        "Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them. (This was the disciple who had leaned back against Jesus’ chest at the meal and asked,",
        "Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?)",
        "So when Peter saw him, he asked Jesus,",
        "Lord, what about him?",
        "Jesus replied,",
        "If I want him to live until I come back, what concern is that of yours? You follow me!",
        "So the saying circulated among the brothers and sisters that this disciple was not going to die. But Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die, but rather,",
        "If I want him to live until I come back, what concern is that of yours?",
        "This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.",
        "There are many other things that Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."

        "do you have a pet Randy?",
        "currently we have a poodle.",
        "it's miniature.",
        
        "I read somewhere that the poodles is one of the the most intelligent dogs around.",
        "So you you've only known the dog how long did you say?",
        "Well, about a year I guess.",
        "how old is the dog?",
        "It just turned two, I believe.",
        "it's still just a pup.",
        "Pretty much, yeah, yeah.",
        "Oh, that sounds interesting.",
        "she weighs in at about fifty pounds, so she's a medium size.",
        "But she's big enough to be intimidating,",
        "she was teaching me.",
        "Oh, I wouldn't doubt it, yeah.",
        "She's the most intelligent dog I've ever seen.",
        "You know, the first time I brought her home, she was only, was it six weeks old. And I spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area.",
        
        "But, next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom.",
        "So, on next night, I spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there.",
        "But it wasn't too long until she, found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning.",
        "I live alone.",
        
        "we've always got, got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door.",
        
        "She's definitely ready to get out and run around.",
        "Well my dog is an outdoor type", 
        "she does not like to be indoors.",
        "she'd rather sleep outside on the cold ground at night.",
        "Oh wow.",
        "I do make her come in.",
        "And I feed her indoors", 
        "that's to lure her in, but during the day I have her on a on a leash,",
        "which is, on sort of a run. I have a, a thirty foot cable,",
        "running from one stake to another, and then attached to that is a twelve foot leash,",
        "so she can cover quite an area.",
        "Most definitely.",
        "And, she's the best, burglar alarm going.",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah that's, definite security involved in, in a dog like that.",
        "Oh, yeah, she, - it's the strangest thing, though, children, no matter how strange they are, or how new they might be can walk, right up to her,",
        
        "she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.",
        "the line is between children and adults.",
        "Yeah, that's interesting.",
        "she is a great comfort to me.",
        "I know our dog has had some different reactions.",
        "if the child is pretty straight forward she's fine.",
        
        "it's a matter of exposure really.",
        "we took her home to my family's place in South Dakota",
        "she was the one that was intimidated then.",
        "There was about seven kids ranging from about three years to ten years running around the house all at one time,",
        "She really didn't know how to handle herself.",
        "You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.",
        "What's her name by the way?",
        "what do you call the dog?",

        "I had a similar experience.",
        "I grew up on a farm so I always had outdoor pets.",
        
        "he was a real lovable type,",
        "Oh, what a shame.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well Randy, we've just about used up our time here,",
        "I must say it was interesting.",
        "Most definitely.",
        "I enjoyed talking about pets with you.",
        "Well that's great.",
        "Maybe we'll get together again in the future.",
        "That sounds real good.",
        "Take care now.",
        "You too.",
        "Bye.",
        "I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.",
        "I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.",
        "I know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive.", 
        "I have a suspicion that the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico."
        "What is your situation?",
        "I guess I don't have such close experience with an area becoming a state as you do.",
        "My concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low standard of living.",
        "Part of this I suppose is justified in that the climate they don't need.",
        "I guess I would favor status quo.",
        "I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting. I did Peace Corps training there.",
        "Oh that's very interesting.",
        "you know I saw it", 
        "it was very foreign in a certain sense", 
        "I had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem.",
        "It was very lovely and the people seemed very friendly and nice.",
        "I work with a girl from Puerto Rico", 
        "I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors.",
        "I'm not quite sure how the they cope with this sort of thing.",
        "I've live abroad most of my life",
        "I've been very cut off.",
        "I lived actually in Lebanon", 
        "I was very cut off from the press as I was becoming an adult.",
        "I don't know how the they would cope with a new state that is so very poor.",
        
        "I suppose the whole country would require such aid.",
        
        "Perhaps compulsory education.",
        "taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.",
        "I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.",
        "the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states.", 
        "I had thought of it more in terms of political realization.",
        "Well it sounds as though you are in favor of the status quo.",
        "I believe I would probably tend towards that.",
        "I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance.",
        "I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point.",
        "What about if they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.",
        "I don't think there is any prohibitions.",
        "I would be bothered by that.",
        "I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of my strengths.",
        
        "I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines", 
        "I'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past",
        "a common language is the ultimate bond of a country.",
        
        "I was in bilingual education in California.",
        "I didn't have any problem with my students.",
        "I noticed my brother was learning Spanish in elementary school.",
        "And so, obviously it didn't work in California.",
        "Yeah, but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual.",
        "I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.",
        "I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.",
        "I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness.",
        "I think we have gone to time",
        "I appreciate your having called.",
        "Okay, well thank you very much.",
        "Good bye.",
        "Bye, bye.",

        "I am new to Texas, so I don't even know what the law is,",
        "we do have capital punishment.",
        
        "It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks get into the system.",
        "That happens on occasion",
        
        
        "there are so many chances for appeal.",
        "it's really sad.",
        "someone is calling for someone else to be killed.",
        "I suspect I would be, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that. Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.",
        "That's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and,",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Not with me personally.",
        "It is with a lot of other people.",
                
        "I think most states do have capital punishment.",
        "Uh-hhuh.",
        "But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.",
        "That still does it, that's right.",
        "Yes, they're only, - I was reading something about it the other day, I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.",
        
        "A lot of them had to have el-, elected not to do so. Now I don't know, what they do in place of it. You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something, I don-, I don't know how they handle it bu-, I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.",
        "Have that. Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, are really, - I mean, there's a lot of people that are on death row.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.",
        "Yes, a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.",
        "Uh-huh. So, it seems like a of people live there, and then through appeals. -",
        "Yes.",
        "Because I know they do frequently, - I mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.",
        "Uh-huh. Yes.",
        "If it finally gets to that point.",
        "Right, the first appeal is automatic, so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, <sniffing> things that happen cause a person not to,",
        
        "have to go through the whole thing.",
        "are we doing lethal injection now?",
        "That's that's fairly recent.",
        "it's a little bit more humane",
        "I am sure I would take the lethal injection.",
        "Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "I would have to lean toward capital punishment.",
        "I don't think it's a monetary thing.",
        
        "Some of the crimes are just so brutal.",
        "This may seem to be the best way out.",
        "Easiest way out maybe.",
        "I don't think it's a monetary thing.",
        "I notice that the crime rate was up.",
        "It's kind of been scary,",
      
        "And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that.",
        "I wish I had the answer for that.",
        "You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the, +",
        "it's nothing to be proud of.",
        "we have been a really fortunate family,",
        "hasn't had any crime.",
        "Yes, so have we been very, very fortunate.",
        "And, so we don't, - it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.",
        "That's right. Absolutely.",
        "And how they would expect, +",
        
        "Absolutely.",
        "And you wonder why they can't just stop it.",
        "Uh-huh. That's right.",
        "So, maybe you would, -",
        
        "but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.",
        "So would I, - I fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance, I hope I never am, like, like everybody else.",
        "No, I know when, um, - we just, we moved here, I from the, I got a summons, jury summons, ]",
        
        "just like constantly, it seemed like,",
        
        "but fortunately I had small children and I didn't have to go.",
        "Right.",
        "And it's not that, I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,",
        
        "it's just that, I didn't, - I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.",
        "Sure, it's, it's a big responsibility, it really is.",
        "And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case,",
        "Yes.",
        "involving a violent crime or anything.",
        "So would I.",
        "That would be really awful.",
        "Yes. Absolutely.",
        "Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, talking to you about this.",
        "It is, it's a tough subject, it really is.",
        "I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, guess it's important,",
        "Right.",
        "that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.",
        "That's right.",
        "Anyway, well, you have a good day.",
        "Well, thank you, it's nice talking to you.",
        "Thank you, bye-bye.",
        "Uh-huh. Bye-bye.",
        "Hi. How are you doing?",
        "What, I couldn't hear you?",
        "I said, how are you doing?",
        "I'm doing fine. I'm, just editing a spreadsheet right now. I'm trying to figure out how I can retire without having to work until I'm ninety-five.",
        "Yeah. We've been doing that too. We're trying to retire in our fifties.",
        "Yeah. This is a very appropriate topic for our, conversation today because what I'm figuring out is that I'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what I'm making.",
        "Good luck on that one, then.",
        "What is that?",
        "I said good luck on that one, then.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "So you work for it T I then <music>. You can't say?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of. They could go visit them during the day. What?",
        "Yeah that's something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children. But, I can see how it would be a a real benefit. Yes I do.",
        "Well, we keep a shelter, also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too. You know, go on and pay a lump sum and as long as you pay that amount you're okay. But if you paid in more than you actually used, and the same thing for insurance, what you predict your going to be paying for insurance, as long as you pay, actually pay out that amount of money, you're okay. But if you pay out less, then you lose that money.",
        "Um.",
        "I don't like that part, but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.",
        "Well, that could be, I could see where that would be important.",
        "And then we got that cafeteria plan, do you have that?",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "I don't know what it's about .",
        "You can, - well you, - let's see, it, it shelters you're money that you pay for, for insurance. It takes it out of your salary before taxes.",
        "Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah we got that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Pretax insurance?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But we call it the cafeteria plan, I wonder why.",
        "Um?",
        "I said, I wonder why.",
        "Oh, it's probably what the first guy who did it, called it.",
        "Cafeteria?",
        "Yeah. He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it.",
        "Maybe so. Let's see what else can we do? Changes, -",
        "I'll tell you what we could do.",
        "What?",
        
        "You mean, like for health insurance?",
        "Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company. See, I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay. Now, if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find (A) a place to put them or (B) you know, boot them out.",
        "Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, school teaching.",
        "Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid.",
        "Thank you.",
        "What?",
        "I said, thank you.",
        "Oh.",
        "We're both school teachers.",
        "Oh, I'm, I'm, -",
        "But it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good.",
        "I know.",
        "It's almost impossible.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Um.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Then you have tenure. And they can't fire you.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Well, you know, in a situation like that, I don't know if that's good or bad. I do know that I've had tenured professors that were just sorry.",
        "Right.",
        "And I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs.",
        "Well, they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago, you know, in the public schools.",
        "But in addition. -",
        "It makes you more at ease. You know, you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous.",
        "Well, they, they really can't fire you without cause, you know the governments taken care of that, but, um, what I'm looking at is, you know, there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid, and there are some teachers <noise> out there that aren't worth having around as janitors.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, and I could see a point protecting someone's position, but, on the other hand, I don't think it, you know, that someone that teaches, say shop, for instance, should have to have degree at all.",
        "Well they don't.",
        "Well. -",
        "In some places they don't.",
        "In some places that don't.",
        "Do they?",
        "But, you know, you, you get specialized education now, for instance, take computer science. We've got kids twenty years old, right now, that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications. I know we could. And these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches, because there's no comprehensive test that they can take, that would allow them to, to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college.",
        "You know, I went to college late on in life and I realize that hey, it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable, you know what I mean?",
        "I mean, my agree is absolutely worthless.",
        
        "It's my experience and, and my knowledge that, that is beneficial, but then, you know, like I said, I came in backwards.",
        "What did you get your degree at?",
        "Industrial Marketing.",
        "And what's your job now?",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Maybe. All right, what else could we change? Oh, I'd like to see flexible hours. And teaching,",
        "Well uh,",
        "shared, job sharing,",
        "We've, +",
        "more of that.",
        "we've, we've already got that.",
        "Well, see, we've got a little bit of it, but not much. It would be nice if you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing. What else. I'd like to be able to, to evaluate your boss and it really carry some weight, and you get to choose your boss.",
        "Well, - yeah. Supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one. Especially in my line, because, you know, my supervisor has nothing to with my job, except to make sure I get my check.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        
        "Well, so you get to evaluate him though?",
        "Well, not really. You know, I mean, there's, what's to evaluate about him, you know, I mean, my, my, supervisor level is like practically zero. I run the whole show. And when I need something, I tell my boss and he gets it for me, because he knows, that I know, what I'm doing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Yeah. Well it's tough, but, you know, there are requirements, and quotas, what not, for me to make, but, um, the bottom line on, on that kind of thing is, you know, we have a lot of people, especially in major corporations, who aren't doing a damn thing. They're just there. You know, the work they do could be totally eliminated, and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything. But, it's just that their jobs are useless. Take, for instance, um, a large construction company I used to work for. Ed Swampers. Swampers is a guy, who's in the union. He's a laborer. And he's assigned to, -",
        "Okay, in order to make the, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken,",
        
        "until it was nice and brown, you know make sure it's nice and brown on both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it <cough>.",
        
        "And then you, you, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan and you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil. Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there. And then you, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water. Stir it real, real well.",
        
        "Then you, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy. And you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.",
        "Oh.",
        "And that's going to, it's going to be really good.",
        "That's very spicy, too.",
        "Yeah, it's, -",
        "I mean these bell peppers and curry.",
        "Right, and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.",
        "Oh, that sounds really good.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Huh. I guess it was, - is this dinner time for you?",
        "well it will be in a little while, I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.",
        "All done in advance, yeah. That's um, - I, I'm, I'm not that great a cook but I was single until I was thirty so I did cook a little, you know.",
        "Oh.",
        "and I cook a little bit now. What I like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.",
        
        "And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.",
        "What kind of wok do you have, is it, is it a real Chinese wok.",
        "It's, it's called a stir fry pan and it, and it fits right on your, st-, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.",
        "Uh-huh. I see.",
        "And, um, normally what happ-, what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi-, vegetable oil. But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things. And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, beforehand. That gives, spicier flavor and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, sometimes chicken broth,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a, a glaze,",
        
        "that sticks to the, the vegetables, I've used, - you turn them over. A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu, we don't put in meat,",
        
        "cause I guess we're, I'm not - but, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things, so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.",
        "Oh that's, +",
        "It's, it's a pretty big - and we put that over rice.",
        "That sounds real good except the squash, I just don't like squash.",
        "Oh, you don't.",
        "I never did. My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash and she'd have squash and corn bread.",
        "Oh.",
        "And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.",
        
        "And I'd just be, -",
        "Yeah, see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up. My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up. I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.",
        
        "Yeah, recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.",
        
        "Red meat and a potato.",
        "Oh, that sounds good. We, we were from North Carolina and we had a garden and my mother would, would, grow the squash and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of, -",
        "Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.",
        "Right.",
        "See, never, no vegetables in my family.",
        "Wow.",
        "Yeah, it was really funny.",
        "You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens.",
        "Well that was a real farm.",
        "You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?",
        "No, but I, I've, I've heard stories I've heard stories.",
        "And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.",
        "Uh.",
        "And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub and finally it dies down, you get just a little patter and then it, -",
        "Oh, this is ter-, - you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.",
        "Getting ready to eat chicken too.",
        "That's right, you should be careful. That's pretty funny.",
        
        "But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs, we, we bought everything in a grocery store.",
        
        "There was no, - but it was funny, you know, - it - so, but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, you know, a lot of changes.",
        "Well that's good. A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.",
        "I think so too,",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Yeah, I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.",
        "Uh-hwell that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future,",
        "Yeah.",
        "but, the cut back. I, recently was over a friends house that's Indian and, she had brought Indian sweets into the office and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Yeah, that was a sweet and I was like ugh.",
        
        "This is a sweet. Oh it is, it's a candy, I'm like ugh, you know, Indian candy is not very good.",
        "right.",
        "But everything was, and everything, - you didn't notice it at first, but everything was sort of hot. Everything had a little bit of curry in it.",
        "The spice, yeah.",
        "It was funny, even the sweets did.",
        "Wow.",
        "When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it. You know, it had that, that after taste that, - very, it was a very Indian flavor.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Good, they didn't have, - I didn't like her desserts very well, they were very, yogurt and carrots and pin-, pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt.",
        
        "And it wasn't very good.",
        "Well I might have liked some of that I, I like hot stuff,",
        
        "I really do.",
        "Yeah, well have we done our ten minutes.",
        "Oh is it ten minutes.",
        "Something like that, I think we're, -",
        "I don't know, do we get a signal.",
        "No, nor-, normally they just come in and they say you've overextended your, your conversation.",
        "Oh, well this is my first one.",
        "Oh, okay well that's, - you'll see it will normally, it will come on and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes to compl-, fifteen seconds to complete it.",
        "Oh wow.",
        "But, I've been cut off twice.",
        
        "So I just thought, - in fact I'm just also, - I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know, he has one of those alarms on his car,",
        "Goodness.",
        "one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it's going off.",
        
        "So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.",
        "Well, okay.",
        "Okay, hey thanks so much.",
        "Yeah, thank you, it was nice talking with you.",
        "Uh-hand you said this was your fi-, - well you'll, you'll get a couple more probably.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I, I called yesterday, I, or Friday, maybe I talked to somebody that, I got them on, during the day. It was a housewife and she was home with two kids.",
        "Ugh.",
        "And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, you know, that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time, it was pretty funny.",
        "Yeah, kind of hard that way.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey thanks a lot, I'll talk to you later.",
        "All right, thank you, bye-bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "<Beep> Yes, I saw HOME ALONE with some friends just a couple days ago. I wanted to see it, because there was, much recommended,",
        
        
        "Yeah, right, uh-huh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Right.",
        
        
        "Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        
        "Yeah, tha-, well, that's true, it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.",
        "Yeah, it is, it is, and I guess you don't have to, but, you know, if you look at oh, - have you ever seen any of the movies?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "The French movies that . -",
        "No, not really, the last movie I saw I guess, was, the one about the French, the Frenchman that leaves and comes back, and he's someone different. Um, he's, - well, it's about a man, that, leaves his home and comes back to his wife, and his wife's all excited but the guy that comes back is not her original husband, but, um.",
        "Um.",
        "O'Gear , um, I'm sure you've heard of it, it was a very famous, popular movie. Norman Gray, Norman Gear.",
        "No, I'm not with you so far,",
        "Oh, shoot, I'm going to hit myself after I hang up. I'll remember the name.",
        
        
        
        
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "They have, they have a - Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated Am-, of sophisticated American everywhere.",
        "Right.",
        "Oh, uh-huh.",
        "Right.",
        
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, uh-hyeah, I see what you're saying, there's less character development, rather just the, the, the funniness of the gag,",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Did you go with kids though?",
        "Did you go with kids?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Did you take kids along?",
        "No, we went, without the kids, it's was a night out, away from the children.",
        "Oh.",
        
        "especially to come home and, you know, I would have gotten in trouble the next day, I'm sure.",
        "Uh-hyeah, that, that's true. I, I was thinking about that too, I saw that, um, that's why I watched another silly movie, um, um, with my cousin, was the one about the, um, the turtles,",
        "Oh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.",
        
        "And your cousin's a kid,",
        
        "Yeah, isn't it amazing.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        
        "Right.",
        
        
        
        "on the one hand I'd like it to be a warning, on the other hand I wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee, now we want to see the aftermath all the time either.",
        "You're right, uh-hyeah, it's true.",
        
        
        "Really.",
        
        "Yeah, right, right.",
        
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        
        
        
        "Right.",
        "That's true. Yeah, there's not too many that are, that are good just on their, you know, that, that you wouldn't want to change something, and there's always something that, -",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        
        "Oh, really.",
        
        "Yeah, right.",
        
        
        "Yeah, yeah, they leave, -",
        "those ones, that just stick in your head.",
        
        "No, it could be.",
        
        
        "Um. Okay, well, I guess I got to get going,",
        "Okay, well, um, thanks for hearing me rap, I guess.",
        "Got to go take care of the children,",
        "All right, nice talking with you.",
        "Yeah, nice talking with you. Are you calling from Texas, by the way?",
        "No, I'm in California .",
        "Oh, okay, the first person I've talked to outside of Texas.",
        "Yeah, there must be Texas people, as near as I can tell. Well. -",
        "Yeah, okay, well, thank you very much.",
        "Okay, well, I'm from the . -",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "All right, bye-bye.",
        "Okay, we're rolling. I, - what, what would you, what would, has your experience lead you to advise, if my child were thinking of going to the",
        "Well, I'd encourage it.",
        
        "It's a good general e-, ed-, education for a, a bachelor's degree.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "And obviously, and obviously it's where they don't have a, any post graduate program there, but you get a, an excellent, wide, basis of topics. You know, you get a good broad education out of it.",
        
        
        "Uh-huh-huh-huh.",
        "Uh,",
        "How do you feel about, - it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college. How does that, - how do you feel that is for someone at, at that phase in their life?",
        "Well, the for some people, it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline, need a little reining in at that, that stage in their life. other people, - it, it's, suffocating,",
        
        "Uh-huh-huh-huh.",
        
        
        
        "And if you've been in for twelve years, I'm sure you've,",
        
        "you've got a, your share of student loans that, you're probably going to be paying off or have been or, -",
        "Well, I sort of, - one of the reasons it's taken so long is I've been working all, you know,",
        
        "sort of half student, half working and source of income and stuff, so I'm actually managing to do this with zero debt. B.30",
        "I couldn't, you couldn't do it otherwise.",
        "Oh, y-, I mean I know people that graduated, or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they, they've got twenty, thirty thousand dollar debts, I mean you could have, -",
        "Yeah, I think if there's any major piece of advice I'd give, is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's not, - I mean, I remember seeing an article one time about, you know, if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a, a, in an investment fund, they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So, it's, it's really kind of crazy.",
        
        "Really?",
        "A year.",
        "Huh.",
        "At just a small, - I mean they, they, they are s-, it is a select, ]",
        "Yes, yes, I know.",
        "college.",
        "I was actually, I th-, I was thinking ] of trying to get a job there. I heard of it.",
        "Oh, yeah. But, you're talking incredible tuitions now.",
        "Uh-uh.",
        "I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot. Very few I would imagine.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, I get, - I just couldn't ima-, - I mean it's more money that I make in a year, so, -",
        
        "You know, it, you know, - me being one person with a above the median income,",
        "Yeah.",
        "for New York state, you know, - I'm a s-, I'm a second lieutenant in the",
        
        "I, - even as a somebody making twice what I was making, how could you put half of that into, +",
        
        "to your child's education and then just when they make, made, make it to the college years it's, -",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "My God, I can't imagine.",
        "Well, my, my real feeling about, about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time, yes, you do get an education, you do learn some things, but you eventually forget most of it.",
        "Yes.",
        "But what you don't forget is the growing up. It's really the period when people become adults. I mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways. But, really, it's the entry into adulthood, I think. And I think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become, you know, as you gain new social skills, as you become, you know, more of a functioning member of society. And maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect, - as you said for someone who, you know, a more, you know, who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them.",
        "Or, it's also a good environment, it may be good for someone who already has self discipline, who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own,",
        "Yeah,",
        "that, -",
        "and want to develop that.",
        "And, that, - yeah, the s-, - it's the same.",
        
        "It can benefit different people different ways.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "But, you know, I, I agree with that, because I see people that I know f-, again, from high school,",
        
        "that I still keep in touch with,",
        
        "that didn't go to college and they do the same old things they did in high school and,",
        "The same patterns of behavior, you mean?",
        "Same patterns of behavior,",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "same, same socializing, same exact crowd that they hang with and it's like, it's like frozen time, you know.",
        "Exactly, it's ki-, I find it kind of sad, I really do.",
        "It is. It really is that they haven't found anything, anything better that, - or their, their experiences haven't been broadened at all,",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "you know, or different opinions.",
        "Yeah, in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems.",
        "Yeah, exactly, yeah.",
        "Yeah, the, the one thing I think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions. These institutions of th-, thirty thousand students and such.",
        "Oh I, -",
        "And I see some freshmen wandering around in there and they're, they're just like, you know, someone from the country lost in the big city, I mean,",
        "Yeah.",
        "they, they, - I don't see them getting, - I mean when I was undergraduate, I went to a, relatively small school for my first two years and then I transferred to a very large school.",
        
        "And that worked out pretty well. I went from a, you know, a second rate institution to a higher rate institution.",
        
        "But the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was. I needed to make friends. I needed to sort of learn the ropes. You know, there were things like that, that mattered a lot more and I needed basic, really simple education that you can get, pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years.",
        "Well, your education's a lot what you make of it, too, so, -",
        "Yeah, yeah, exactly. And if you're alienated, - I mean I see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems,",
        "Yeah.",
        "that, you think this isn't sinking in.",
        "Well, I, I've seen more graduates from M I T and that, -",
        
        "being, - I work in a, in a labora-, an Air Force laboratory and so we've got a lot of, M I T graduates that are in there and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that, I think I've ever run into.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Even, even more so, like, military academy grads are a strange lot, too, I, I mean I have to ad-, confess to that.",
        "Yeah, it's sort of a, a rare select environment.",
        "Yeah, and they have their own quirks and tolerances and,",
        
        "you know, certain things that don't bother us at all,",
        "Yeah.",
        "that would drive other people nuts and then certain things that - ways, things we do, - the way we do it that drive other people nuts that, -",
        "Right, right, sure.",
        "But, these M I T grads are off in their absolute own world. It, it's a, - I, I have more re-, I have a lot of respect for M I T master's and doctorate, uh,",
        "Yeah. It's a top rated institution and now I, -",
        "degrees, but they're undergrads are like, - I, I'm amazed, at, at that's a lot of them even graduated.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "But, I don't know.",
        "Well, I, I had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school.",
        "Right.",
        "Not realizing that the reputation for M I T is because of the, of the doctorate research,",
        "Right.",
        "Nope.",
        "Yeah.",
        "reputation for, for research and that's a one standard, but it's not relevant,",
        "No.",
        "to what they need.",
        "It's interesting that you mention, - and I didn't think about that before when you were talking, but the service academies have all, all the faculty, for the most part is, is military with a few exchange,",
        
        "instruct-, professors from other,",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "schools. But, having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there, is investing in the Air Force, and it, -",
        "Right.",
        "or the, the military itself, it's the future officer corps and so, I hear hor-, horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors, they could never get extra help.",
        
        
        
        "Huh.",
        "when I was having trouble with something and, -",
        "Yeah, you won't get that at M I T or virtually or anything like that.",
        "No, no, and that, -",
        "And you c-, you know, and you can't blame the professors either,",
        "No.",
        "because you look at their job description, you'd s-, you know, - teaching is third down on the list of importance things and, -",
        "Right, right. Publish first, and the, -",
        "yeah, and, and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research, because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time.",
        "Right.",
        "So I'd say go to a, go to a college that has teachers. People who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, oh, well. -",
        
        "Phil, I guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work, or do you like to do it?",
        "Yeah, well, I, um, - about, or just over a year ago I bought my own house, so this has been the first opportunity I've had to, be working on my own lawn and garden, and, you know, when, back when I was a kid, you know, mom would send me out to weed the garden. I, I'd hate it, you know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, I sort of take pride in, in the yard, and, you know, how the place looks, and, so I don't mind doing it so much anymore.",
        "Yeah, so do you have a, do you have a garden, or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn?",
        "Well, it's, yeah, it's, it's primarily just, like landscaping a little bit. You know, I've got some, bushes around the fou-, you know, foundation planning, things like that, and then there's some, just some little flower beds, and my mom grows, - she's an avid gardener, and she starts her own stuff from seed now, and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them. she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden. They have a huge yard and a huge house, and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras.",
        "Well, that's pretty good.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "My house is on a main road, and it has nothing.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "That's a lot.",
        "Right.",
        "Oh, jeez.",
        
        
        "Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line?",
        "Yes. I'm trying, - I don't know if it's my phone. This is bad. It's not getting any better.",
        "Yeah, I can't even hear what you're <static>, -",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Oh jeez, it's gone.",
        "I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that, but every time I have this phone is a little weird, I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times.",
        "Well, I don't know, there was - well, whatever it was, there was a second there I couldn't even hear what you were saying, but, um, -",
        "Yeah, I was beating on the phone going, Can you hear me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, we grow a lot of, the basic, corn, potatoes.",
        
        "She likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        
        
        "She puts a lot of financial. She plans it all out. Beans like to be near certain types of plants. Now, they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like, peas, I don't know. Something, -",
        "Oh, really because of like the cross-pollination, or, -",
        "No, it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans. I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off, they just don't like each other.",
        "Huh.",
        "I mean, she, she reads all kinds of books, so. I wish I knew more to tell you why, but, -",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, that's really weird.",
        "Yeah, I mean, there, these were like some mutant.",
        "I've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden and like I'll make an L shape I've put my cantaloupe. So they've been pretty close together.",
        "Huh.",
        "But I don't think the vines. They don't real-, they don't have to be touching or anything, like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees,",
        "No, it's just the, like the bees and insects will do it.",
        "Um,",
        "Either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something.",
        "Something weird.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "Oh, well. -",
        "It was really bad because of the water.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, I have to do that, I want to make some flower beds, and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil.",
        
        "Sure.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, it seems, -",
        "I've seen a lot of people use them, you know, for flower beds, but I don't know what, whether they'd have creosote would do anything, I mean, -",
        
        "Well, you can get, um, you can get pressurized lumber,",
        "Yeah, but they put,",
        "Oh, that's right.",
        "some kind of chemicals in there too.",
        "there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too.",
        "Yeah. Well, I'm not really worried about it, it's mainly for flower bed, so I'm not going to, no goi-, I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there.",
        "All right.",
        "But, I, - yeah, I do want to have a raised bed. I've never, - my flower gardens are always been like on the ground.",
        "Right.",
        "They don't, it just looks so much better when it's up against the house, tiered up.",
        "Well, you can see it a little better and it stands out.",
        "Um.",
        "Oh, gee.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Rub up against the siding. Uh,",
        "Yeah, that's what he's worried about. The trees, or a bush, because lilac bushes, they, they grow fast. Some people, would really like to have them, and then the people that do have them, they spread, and they sprout all over th-, their lawn.",
        
        "So, they're kind of a pain, but, you know, people who don't have them think they're great. And people who do have them,",
        
        "curse.",
        "Right.",
        "Another thing I have that, um, is weird is the, a locus tree in the back yard. As a matter of fact there's three of them, very badly trimmed, they aren't trimmed at all.",
        
        "And I can imagine if I had to mow the lawn in the back, which we said we'd do, if the trees hang down - so, and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it.",
        "Yeah, they're like, - I think I've seen those before, but I don't remember what they look like.",
        "They're a pretty tree, but you just, when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns. So we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead,",
        "So it'll give you room to get under it, sure,",
        "Yeah.",
        "Um.",
        "Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree.",
        "Oh, a tree is always something very nice to have.",
        "Yeah, my dad used to work on them, so I don't think I'll have a problem. My husband will have problems borrowing one.",
        "then you got to get him to, - if he's going to do it, you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it.",
        "Well, if that's not the problem ... -",
        "Okay, have you ever served as a juror?",
        "Never. I've never been served on the jury, never been called up in a jury, although some of my friends have been jurors.",
        "Uh-huh. I never have either.",
        "You haven't, huh. If you were, what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers?",
        "Well, I think it's a good idea. I think our justice system needs a major overhaul, and I'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it. But I think they've got a lot of problems.",
        "I think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury, and to get to trial.",
        "True.",
        "And I don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or, or what, but, uh. Sometimes I think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined, and they're too easily swayed by their emotion.",
        "Yeah, I think that's true.",
        "Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES,",
        "T V shows.",
        "Yeah. Do, would you prefer all trials by a judge?",
        "No, I think there are certain things that, the jury can determine as far as, guilty or not guilty, but as far as the af-, af-, affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature, I don't know if that is best left up to the jury to de-, to award, you know. Two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing, you know, it's true that, you know, this may be sad and all that thing, but, the jury I think is best, in most cases, suited for determination of guilt and innocence, but not the award of, of penalties and fines and punishment.",
        "Yeah, I would agree with that. I think you're righ-, I think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company, and, -",
        
        "If they give them all the information. I don't know, when it comes to sentencing phase, I guess they tell them if a guy, if the person has a previous record and stuff.",
        
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah. Do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury?",
        
        
        "And they took it more as just like a majority.",
        "Oh.",
        "So I, I, -",
        "Some of them disagree, I mean, some of them said one way and some the other.",
        "Exactly, but they took, you know, whatever the majority was. So I didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is. I always thought it had to be unanimous.",
        "I think it does have to be unanimous.",
        "But, uh. Rather interesting.",
        "I know they can poll a jury, make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was, but I thought that they all had to agree or else they, it was a hung jury.",
        
        "And, -",
        "I did, I did also.",
        "Yeah, I thi-, I don't know how I feel about that. I think maybe, majority might be sufficient.",
        
        "It's hard to say though.",
        "What about in international trials. Do you think they should have a jury there?",
        "Oh.",
        "I think that would be kind of interesting.",
        "Yeah, I hadn't thought about international trials at all.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Nobody.",
        "Yeah,",
        "So. But I think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of, you know, people from different countries, in as international law also.",
        
        "Right.",
        "Things like that.",
        "I don't know how, what it would take to be, come up with a true perfect system, or if one exists. But, -",
        "Yeah. What about uniform sentencing?",
        "is that the crime and it's already, some chart and determine the punishment, or. -",
        "Right. Yeah, like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years. It's not a discretionary thing.",
        
        "Yeah. I wish that when they sentence someone, if they're going to sentence him to five years, then make him serve five years.",
        "Yeah, that serves a kind of if they're, I guess, - if you sentence someone to life, life is only forty-nine years, something like that.",
        "Yeah, I, -",
        "And I guess you're eligible after twenty-seven for parole, even though you're in for life.",
        "Yeah, and sometimes those people are, are young enough, they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble.",
        "Yeah, although I guess it's, you, you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time.",
        "Yeah, I don't believe that very often happens.",
        "No. Because inside the jail there, I don't think there's no real rehabilitation.",
        "I don't think so either. In fact, I think they end up worse, because the conditions are so bad.",
        "Yeah, it's another war zone.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, who knows.",
        "I think, I think maybe they ought to just be punished with some, some kind of real punishment, like hard labor for a shorter length of time, you know.",
        "I agree, get them out there,",
        "Actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the, you know, world and not spend so much time sitting around, letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them, and, -",
        "Sure, they should have them go out and doing stuff.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Cleaning up, or picking up dirt, or weeds, or who knows what. Something for the, for the state, since the state is paying for them, they should get some kind of, kind of work out of them.",
        "Yeah. Something besides license plates and tiddlywinks.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think that covers it.",
        "I think so.",
        "Nice talking to you.",
        "Nice talking to you also.",
        "Bye.",
        "Have a wonderful Easter.",
        "You, too.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "All righty. So, do you think Russia's still a threat?",
        "Well, I guess I'm maybe naive, but I never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us.",
        "There you go <TV>.",
        "I mean, obviously there's <talking> the, the, the possibility of, or, was the possibility of war, but, I somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable, but, I don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that, that I think this question was meant. What about you?",
        "Well, I think, - h-, have you ever read the book NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR?",
        "Yes.",
        
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "And these people are the same as you are.",
        "Right.",
        "And what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country, supposedly U S or Russia attacks a country, it's not going to be within the borders of the U S or Russia itself. Like I was telling people, I'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on. In Lith-, in Lithuania, they, they were announced to be a separate country. But, yet, the, the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the U. S. didn't go in there and try to save those people.",
        "Right.",
        "You know. It's like you're not going to go in there and say no, listen, there's a separate country. Why, because you're going into the border.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "Right. Once you get into the border, then there's a threat. {C",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "You know, and now it's like you know, they're saying other people were, were I guess, other leaders were still crazier about it, you know, like other people, you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there, but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "And the U S has. You know, it's like they, it seems like they can, their, their army or whatever can, can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do, do the job with, you know, less suffering.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "You know, but I think, I think the thing is, is that there, the thing - like they were saying they go, you know, - like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button. But not the U S S R,",
        "Right.",
        
        
        "Because they got too much at stake.",
        "But I guess there was concern, that I-, Iraq would use, you know, nonconventional warheads with, with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didn't happen.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well,",
        
        "Right.",
        "And what happens is, what happens is, - suppose they get Saddam Hussein, which they eventually will, he's got one less thing to go against him.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        
        "Right.",
        "We'll overthrow you, but yet you can still come live here, you know.",
        "Right, I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet.",
        "no.",
        
        "No.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "Right.",
        "You know.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "Well, it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the U S.",
        "No, I, I don't think so. I think, they're getting, they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV, - a lot of, inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to.",
        "Right.",
        "A lot of like dancers and stuff like that.",
        "Right.",
        "They said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete. So it must be a beautiful country.",
        
        "It's just that, you know, they won't let you get out and when you want to get out of the country, that's what you want to do.",
        "Right, right.",
        "So, oh, well, I got to go to class now.",
        "Okay, well thanks.",
        "Nice talking to you.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "So, what do you think about a year or two of public service?",
        
        "Yeah. Yeah.",
        
        
        "they're encouraged to do that, missionary work, and I be-, I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our,",
        "You know, I, +",
        "society better.",
        
        
        
        
        "Huh.",
        "Um, beca-, so that was, that was one reason why I never considered it but now that I'm further along, and I'm still paying these college loans,",
        "I, I think realistically, you know, you can have your college loans delayed now, because I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school at thirty years old,",
        "Yeah.",
        "Huh.",
        "Yes.",
        "that does that?",
        "Yes.",
        "Because one of my neighbors, did that in Pittsburgh, from Pittsburgh.",
        
        "And I thought, you know, that really, - now that I'm thirty years old, I think that one or two years out of my life would have, - probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country,",
        
        "I think it would have been a very good, um, experience for me.",
        
        
        "and things like that and I think that it would help people to become,",
        "Yes.",
        "less self-centered,",
        
        "and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to, um,",
        
        "thinking less of your own needs but,",
        "Yeah.",
        "of other people.",
        
        
        "Oh, no.",
        "Many of the boys in the room had children and they were, they were high school juniors.",
        
        "Right.",
        
        "I think it's a really good idea. And even if it is overseas. See, I never, - I, I tell you sometimes I worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.",
        "Yes.",
        
        "Yeah.",
        
        "I don't exactly recommend <noise>,",
        "Yeah.",
        "but still they have benefited from it.",
        "Right. Uh-huh.",
        
        
        "Yeah. I think it would also help them if they then went on to college. I know that my first couple of years of college were, um, probably too carefree at the,",
        
        "beginning and then at the end I had to be too serious. .",
        "Well, that's right. A lot of people they flunk out or they get, +",
        
        "they just get so excited to be away from home,",
        
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "Uh-hthat's right.",
        "Um.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "you know, -",
        
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        
        "Oh, I think it is.",
        "And so, -",
        
        
        
        "And they're preoccupied with,",
        
        "drinking.",
        "Yeah, I think that's, just having a good time.",
        "Uh-huh. And <clicking>, -",
        "I, - a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented.",
        
        "I guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it,",
        
        "you know, today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented,",
        "That's true. <<Rattling paper noise.>>",
        "and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun.",
        "That's really true.",
        "Uh-huh. Yeah.",
        "Yeah. Well, I, I don't know how that would ever happen here but at least, um, -",
        "Well, they say, - I think I, um, have read recently that, the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps.",
        "Oh, really.",
        "Uh-huh. Because I guess because of the changes in Eastern Europe, they've increased funding for the Peace Corps. Some of the, I guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense, you known, -",
        
        "when they're decreasing some of the military spending,",
        "Huh.",
        "some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the are the overseas programs. Uh,",
        "Well, I have seen a big change, I think, in high school kids that my relatives <<rattling paper>>,",
        
        
        "Yeah. Yeah, that's true.",
        "And they don't have a goal, they don't have a goal, they don't have an interest in their own field of study.",
        
        "They're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.",
        "Yeah, that's very true. You know, how many, - is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country, and I guess, - I, I live near Washington, being in, in Baltimore, it's something like one in four people,",
        
        "in the Washington,",
        "Area.",
        "area, are lawyers,",
        "Yes.",
        "And, and I just sort of think that's ridiculous.",
        "Yes.",
        "There's just too many people.",
        
        "That's right. Not enough people want to do that to, +",
        
        "for, because of a service that they could provide.",
        "Right.",
        
        "Yeah, you saw,",
        "be rich. -",
        "statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.",
        
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "That's kind of sad. Well, anyway. -",
        "That's interesting. Uh-huh.",
        "Well, I guess I better go.",
        "Okay. Hey, thanks so much for the conversation.",
        "Well, good luck to you. I enjoyed it.",
        "Well, thank you very much. Bye-bye.",
        "Thanks. Bye-bye.",
        "Okay.",
        "If you want to go first, go ahead.",
        "Oh, I think, I think that a woman's role has come a long way. We have gone more into the business aspect of, like I say, of, I don't know, working more, and we, I think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also.",
        "Yeah, definitely.",
        "With the pay and everything, you know.",
        "I feel that, we've missed as far as the top jobs go.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, the higher echelon.",
        
        "Because if you look at most corporations, there isn't a woman, you know, that's on the board of directors, or that type of thing, they are mostly all men.",
        
        "There may be a few, but very incidental.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I really think that it will be a long time, probably, before we see that. In one sense, I'm an older person, in my fifties, so I feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today.",
        
        "You know, that they are not in the home by choice anymore.",
        
        "It's mostly, you know, - even if you want to say home, you really can't.",
        "And a lot of times you can't, yeah.",
        "You know, it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living, and I don't think raises have kept up with, you know, a lot of the stuff, you know, as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all, you know.",
        
        "So I think that we did come a long way in the sense that we are allowed to vote in, you know, like you say, we're out in the labor force, but I think we've lost something too.",
        "Yeah, my mom, she's a housewife, and, well, there is twelve kids in my family, so my mom never could really work, you know, because she was kind of pregnant from day one. She never really had a chance to work.",
        "Yeah.",
        "She worked before she got married, but, she, she doesn't believe in, - she's very old fashioned. She doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "And I think it's great, but if you, you have a family, I think you owe the family a responsibility.",
        
        
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "You know, in that sense.",
        "Yeah, and also like my mom, my mom thinks, - I mean she's kind of right with it, when both partners of the marriage work, she feels that that's taking more away, that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work.",
        "Oh, definitely.",
        "You know, like for, for the men that don't have jobs, if, you know, she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it, - she said, you know, they could stay at home,",
        "That's right, they don't want to take care of the kids.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And the house and that kind of thing. That's very true, but then they shouldn't have a family.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's what I'm saying, you know, I think it's great that women have a choice today.",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "What do you think about that, do you think that, - what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business?",
        "That's fine, that's, that's the freedom of choice.",
        
        "And I agree with that, because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent.",
        
        "Well, I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent. They won't be a caring parent.",
        
        "Like they won't have that, -",
        "Or they won't be as good as they could be.",
        "Right, that's what I mean, they'll feel like it's a job.",
        
        "It's not like something that they really wanted. Like I had three children, and I mean I, I wanted every one of them.",
        
        "I'm not sorry I had any of them, and I worked third shift for a good part of my life just so I would be home with them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, I had to work, but I tried to make it as painless as possible.",
        
        "In fact, at one time I worked as a second shift, and one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table, and the kids were talking, daddy this, daddy that, daddy this, daddy that, and I was sitting there. It was like I didn't belong anymore.",
        
        "And it was because I had worked for about nine months, and when they were coming home I was going to work.",
        
        "And I wasn't there at supper time or bed time, or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door, I would be going out.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So we were, I felt I was losing my family.",
        
        "And that's why I said that's it, I either have to quit or, you know, try something else, so I went on third shift.",
        
        "And I worked that shift for eleven years.",
        "Oh, my.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Bless you.",
        "Just so that my kids would have me at home.",
        
        "You know, and I feel that's very important, it really is, and it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too.",
        
        "So I mean in the sense that we've come a long way, yes, but we've sacrificed a lot to get there.",
        "Yeah, I, I agree.",
        "And, I really think that if, like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was like out of necessity, because the men weren't here anymore.",
        
        "But then it got to be a point where they got some independence.",
        "And they just enjoyed the income, the extra.",
        "Exactly. A man can afford the necessities, a woman affords the luxuries.",
        
        "And I notice today kids, you know, - like we had apartments before we had homes.",
        
        "And we had to walk before we had a car.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And now kids at sixteen years old, they have their birthday, what do they get, they get a car.",
        "Oh, I know.",
        "And to me, it's like we've lost our values in this country.",
        
        "We really have, and I, I'm not trying to be, you know, a prude or old fashioned or anything, but I, I don't think if you, - unless you earn something and you've worked for it, and you have a sense of pride about it, - because while I did this in, you know, no one gave it to me.",
        
        "You will take better care of that, and you will prize that possession.",
        "Exactly.",
        "More than someone handing something to you.",
        
        "And it's just like college too, I think that if a kid goes to college, and you can help them, fine, but I don't think you should pay the whole way.",
        "See, yeah, see, now, my parents, there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college.",
        "Of course.",
        "And so far there is only two of us that have gone, and my older brother has paid his entire way, and I'm on my, - I have six weeks left and I'll, you know, I'll graduate, and I paid my entire way, and that's the way it'll go down the line, and like I don't have a car because I'm paying for college, and if I want a car, - my parents always said if we wanted a car, we paid for the car, and we paid for our own insurance, and I think that's right because, -",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh-huh. Like I've had my, you know, - like I know kids up here that have their own cars and money is just given to them, like they still get their allowance, they are twenty years old and they still get an allowance. Well, I have held a summer job, you know, since I, you know, I was in the eleventh grade, and I have had to take care of my own money, I have my own checking account, I pay for my own life insurance, and I know a lot of kids that don't even know, - I mean I tell them I pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor, you know.",
        "Sure, they probably don't even have any.",
        "Well, if they do, they don't know it, you know.",
        "Yeah, exactly, and that's what I say, you'll, you'll be so much better off for it as you get older, because, you know, a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff, but it's because you've been there.",
        
        "Oh, I know.",
        
        "You know, there is no harm in that, whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid, you know.",
        
        "Just attention, you know.",
        
        "Uh.",
        "Actually I think abortion is going to take a turn where there is not going to be as many, because I think contraceptives are going to be more popular. I mean I realize that they are popular now, but I think, I really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion, I don't think there is going to be as many abortions, but I don't know what women will do when they get into politics, you know, about abortion.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "I think it will be freedom of choice.",
        
        "Exactly, yeah.",
        "Or maybe not. I don't know.",
        
        "I mean no one has said for sure, you know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, -",
        "I think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics, I think it will definitely be freedom of choice.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        
        "Which I mean I think it should be anyway.",
        "I, I do. I'm Catholic, and we, we are not supposed to, you know, say that that's okay, but I really feel that it's freedom of choice.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I do.",
        "Because I mean you as an individual, what you do, that to me is your business.",
        
        "And, -",
        "And different circumstances call for different things.",
        "Exactly, exactly, that's ... -",
        "Okay.",
        
        
        "and spring break with the kids I, um, I hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there. Have you been keeping up?",
        "Well, just really the last couple of days since this, the, U N debate or whatever you want to call it that, voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire. I guess, you know, the thing really isn't over.",
        
        "They, they had, kind of, I don't know if you call it standout or whatever but anyway they stopped and waited to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though. As I understand it, from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the U N, had set up, you know, - the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all,",
        
        "unless they're just absolutely forced to.",
        "Um.",
        "Start up.",
        "There's no official document signed or anything?",
        "Not yet. Not yet at all.",
        "Well, I, um, when the, when the crisis began last August I began to think well I, I couldn't remember things that I had studied in the past in school and all so I got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history.",
        
        "And it was really, - what I felt was kind of cynical because it there just hasn't been any peace over there ever.",
        "No.",
        "In thousands of years,",
        "Yeah. I don't know,",
        "of history.",
        "why they expect it's going to start this week, you know.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "That's right. And it just, it's just not people they, - and it's not, you know, - there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves.",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "And they fight with each other and they have such hatred for, Israel and, -",
        "Yeah. The, the thing that's kind of interesting about this, - my sons in the Air Force.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "And, he came within a quarter of an inch of going, to Saudi, - he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock.",
        "Um.",
        "So he ended up going to Korea and his buddies ended up going to Saudi. Well, he's still in Korea and his buddies home now.",
        "Oh, no.",
        "He, he almost wishes that, that he could have gone home.",
        "And got it over with.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I just, there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace.",
        
        "And, um, with, - and that I'm afraid that we would have to stay.",
        
        
        
        "Right.",
        "So, the country of, +",
        "<Children>.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's just that this was an excuse, you know, to make some noise <noise>. Now, something that I read in the paper the other day that I thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab, their version or vision or whatever the United States, now, is somewhat changed in that we won, you know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, now we are a, a legitimate player,",
        "<Whispering>.",
        "in the game over there, you know, the, the, - I don't think we can really understand their attitude because there cultures are just so much different.",
        "Right.",
        "But, we are now a legitimate player in the, in the, in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we, you know we defeated, you know - Iran couldn't do it in seven years and we went in and did in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years, you know.",
        "Right.",
        "Right <TV>.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Which is why for centuries or hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there because they'd go in and they'd win something.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, I just, I'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go and call the shots like you say.",
        "Yeah. Yeah.",
        "And I just would prefer that, - I mean sometimes we've said let's keep, we're not interested in what other countries do.",
        
        "And then other times we jump in and do things and while I'm glad that they, - I, - it was important de-, demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't,. I hope we don't try to keep, in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to,",
        "Um.",
        "stay over there because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay.",
        "Yeah. That's, that's the, that's, that's the big thing, you know, we still got a little bit of the old, you know, Vietnam, um, problem, you know, in the back of our minds. We, +",
        "Yeah.",
        "we got this, - we're, we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out. Vietnam we never did get out, you know, never did get the job done because they were too ham strung .",
        "Yeah.",
        "this thing - they, they gave the guys, the power and the material and the, told them to go do it and they did it. You know,",
        "Yeah.",
        "got in and got out. I'm not sure, the, the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks I would think is, you know, the, the business with the, the Shiites of all people, you know, in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds because these people evidently are, you know, being killed off by the thousands.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And whether the, the United Nations, I don't think the U. S. will do it on their own but whether the United Nations comes around and says, hey, wait a minute we know this thing isn't, all that much over, we've got to go back in there and, and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out.",
        
        "Which is, seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment.",
        "Uh-huh. I noticed that.",
        "But, um, you know, -",
        "Well, I don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they,",
        "Oh, well,",
        "expect.",
        "No. No,",
        
        "there, there never will be.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, the only way that you're going to have peace over there, if, if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them, you know, until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but I don't think we want to make that decision either.",
        "No.",
        "So that's, that's a little rough, you know, we're not, we're not quite up to that sort of thing.",
        "No.",
        "So. -",
        "Well, I guess I better go I have a repairman just came,",
        "Oh.",
        "for my refrigerator,",
        "Oh, well, that's, +",
        "But, -",
        "that's fun.",
        "Yeah. Well, I enjoyed the topic. I hope you have a good day.",
        "You too.",
        "Okay. Bye-bye.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Good morning. okay, go ahead.",
        ", no, no, go ahead.",
        "Yeah, I understand the topic this morning is, our policy in Latin",
        "Oh, very good, because actually, um, when I was in college I visited Mexico several times, I was in the Peace Corps and, um,",
        "Oh, uh-huh <<very faint>>.",
        "Peru, but, but recently I have been following the Middle East rather than,",
        "Yeah.",
        "Central America <<very faint>>.",
        "Yeah, it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that's, that's for sure. No, I, - the U S policy, towards Central America as far as, - well, I kind of go back to, to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a, a plant down there for a while, and I worked in there for a little while, and at that particular time, - let's, let's see, that was seventy-three, seventy-four kind of before the, the, the Civil War really picked up down there, and U S policy at that particular time there was, of course, military assistance to, to the government itself, you know, anything that's, that's anti-Communist, you know, we kind of had a tendency to be pro.",
        "Right.",
        "It don't matter what their excesses were, and I believe at the time that I was down there, that, the government, the Salvadorian government you know, really gotten out of hand yet, the, right wing death squad type situation - I believe that, that was beginning to form but I don't, I, I wasn't really aware of it's being, you know, terribly, you know, at the time that, that I was down there, I think that really kind of developed a little bit later on, but, our policies seem to be pretty much one of, you know, trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource, anyway, that Salvador had,, plenty of and that was people.",
        "Right.",
        "We didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's, it's labor,",
        
        "because everything that T I did anyway we, we shipped in and it was worked on down there, assembled, and then sent back here, so, -",
        "Uh-hdid that have, -",
        "I didn't feel that we really ex-, exploiting them any.",
        "Um, so, you don't, you don't feel that, that we were, um, exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting and they weren't.",
        "No, in the particular incidence that I was aware of, now T I wasn't the only ones in there, Playtex was in, there was, several other companies,",
        
        "and, of course, we kind of concentrate on , there wasn't much to take out of the country I felt like we're going in and taken all their, um, their gold or oil,",
        
        "or bananas or coffee or anything like that, because, it just, - the only thing that they had a great abundance of was, you know, human beings and, -",
        "Uh-huh. Di-, did we tend to, um, change their attitu-, attitudes like sometimes when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt",
        "Yeah, I understand what you say. There was a, - the time that I was down there, I stayed quite a, a bit at the, one of the big hotels San Salvador. And at the time I thought there ought to be a law against American tourists. Because they, for the most part, tend to be the most obnoxious as a, as a group, and I saw this in Panama also,",
        
        "oh, you know, it's, it's the, the almost stereotype, you know, flowery shirt, shorts, camera hanging around their neck, you know, demanding this, that and the other thing, you know, we're, we're here, and we want this, and we want that, and that sort of thing, that's, that's the stereotype that's very strong down there, you know, the, the, the, you know, that sort of thing, I, I, I believe those of us who were working down there, got a little bit more appreciation for, you know, the local, culture I really don't believe that we were quite that bad, but yet they were having to deal directly with, you know, with the, the local people.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "And, but boy there is a, there is a bad, you know, the old ] brash or ugly American-type,",
        
        "situation. And I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say, oh, my God those are, those are not",
        "Right.",
        "But there are and, of course, now I, I do have to, I remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad, but I mean, it, I think it's just kind of the North American situation . In Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long but I didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing, as Panamanians are just about as, as, as as Americans, as far as, creature comforts, you know, they're, they're, they're every bit, - I, I know, when, my, my son was in the Air Force - and he was stationed in Panama, and he married a Panamanian girl, and when she came up here, you know, - she's, y-, kn-, except for the language situation, some of the cultures she's just about an American,",
        
        "you know, is as far as T V and, and, you know, the, the moneymaking part of it and all that, matter of fact if anything, she's worse.",
        "Uh-huh-huh <<very faint>>.",
        "But, it, it just, there's little enclaves down there where, you know, Americans have a lot of influence and the local population kind of, um, you know, sort of accepts that, but I've also seen the other side of it, too.",
        "Uh-huh <<very faint>>.",
        "Well, you were in Peru?",
        "Yeah, I was in Peru, but, um, I, there weren't, as I recall, or at least I wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers,",
        "Uh-huh <<very faint>>.",
        "this was when the Peace Corps first are started,",
        
        "and it was one of the big targets and, um, I don't, I don't think, at that time, at least, Peace Corps was, an obnoxious group in the sense that, that we were very controlled regarding number of days off and, +",
        "Oh.",
        "and you couldn't just, take up, take off and leave your group and go explore and, and things like that,",
        
        "but, and I was working actually in the savings and loan program, so, that was quite specialized, although I was living in the slums, I was really working with the middle class.",
        "Uh-huh <<very faint>>. What, what area did you live in?",
        "I was up in Arequipa .",
        "Oh, okay yeah.",
        "And, um <<very faint>>, -",
        "I've heard of it.",
        "Uh-huh <<very faint>> so. -",
        "Well, is, are they, is Peace Corps still active down in there?",
        "I don't have any idea, um, probably not, I mean, there were thir-, I was, Per-, Peru thirteen, which meant there were twelve groups before mine,",
        
        "that had gone in and, and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development, and they were building schools and doing co-ops and things like that, health, um, inoculation and, and things.",
        "Oh, has those influences lasted do you know whether the, the things that, that you and your groups before you did, did those, did those live on or were they reabsorbed or how, -",
        "No, no, I believe they did because, um, some of, some of the, the Peace Corps, that I knew of, did marry Peruvians,",
        "Uh-huh <<very faint>>.",
        "and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things, and of course, the savings and loan program, um, that was, that, you know, that, that just continued to grow. In fact, after my group, - I mean, we were just a very small specialized group, too, to get that going and spread and then, of course, Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's, something that nationalized very quickly.",
        
        "And the same with the co-ops.",
        "Well, that's, that was kind of the, the aim wasn't it, to get it started and then have it,",
        "Right.",
        "taken up by the, - oh, okay, o-, so, you know, well, that's, - I had wondered sometimes, I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that, and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, you know, like,",
        "Uh-huh <<very faint>>.",
        "r-, -",
        "Yeah, I've, you know, some of the programs I would have concern about like, um, the language teaching, you know, I mean, why should we push English,",
        "Uh-huh <<very faint>>.",
        "and a lot of people were down there teaching English and when they talked about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language, you know, to me that's a little bit marginal. I did teach economics at the university one night a week, and the textbook was in English, but basically I taught it in Spanish,",
        "Oh.",
        "because, I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test.",
        "Yeah, my brother-in-law teaches at, Northern Illinois University and they were in China, here a couple of years ago, and he was over there at, the University of Shah and, and teaching ... -",
        "So, describe your family budget.",
        "Well, I've, for a lot of years I, I've ] pretty much flied without one, and, just recently, we, we set up a budget, and, and we're trying to stick to it. We just bought a new house. So we've got everything, you know, pretty much we know what our, our fixed expenses are per month, and then we've got some ones that are variable, that pretty much stay within a certain range, and then, then there's the ones that you never know anything about, and that's, that's the food budget. ]",
        "Well, yeah, and to some extent, utilities, I imagine.",
        "Yeah, well, the utilities are pretty much, - you can pretty much figure what they're going to be, and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you.",
        "They have that to some extent here, but it's not quite as good.",
        
        "And, transportation expenses, I guess you own a car.",
        "Yes sir.",
        "And you know how much you're going to drive every week?",
        "Well, I used to, um, I used to know, fairly close to exactly how many miles I drove, because I, I was very convenient, I lived, nine tenths of a mile from work.",
        "Huh.",
        "So, so, it was, you know, two miles a day to and from work. So it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot. But now I've just bought a new house, and I'm a half hour, and so my transportation costs have gone up by, five times.",
        "Yeah, I understand that. We, we have a real similar situation. Ours, have quintupled, at least. So there is a real family budget.",
        "Yeah, pretty much, um. The problem is there never seems to be enough money. I have three children, and it seems like the more money you make, the more money you have, the more things that they seem to need, and, of course, nothing ever goes down, I mean, I remember, - I have five children total. I have three left in the house.",
        "Yeah.",
        "If you're lucky.",
        "Exempt or nonexempt.",
        "I'm exempt.",
        "Wow, must be nice.",
        
        "Part of the high price spread. no, well, we don't, we do, but we don't have a family budget. We have the fixed things we have to pay.",
        
        "And we have the things that are extras. But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, well, you know, the auto budget, car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry.",
        
        "And insurance, is insurance bad there?",
        "Um, I've got, two older cars. There both, - one's a seventy-seven and one's a seventy-eight.",
        "Well, we've got one eighty-nine.",
        "And my insurance is about, it was running about four hundred dollars a year. But when I moved to the new town I live in, - because it's a different county, which has less crime, and, less, you know, less highways and so it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned, so my, my, I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year.",
        "Wow. That's not bad, four hundred and something a year. That's, that's, -",
        "It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars.",
        "That's cheaper than we pay.",
        "Yeah, I was down in Texas for two years, and I was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance. Um,",
        "Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do you have that there?",
        "they have no fault in Maryland also.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh-huh. Yeah.",
        
        "It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go. here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up.",
        "You're kidding.",
        "Nope. They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company.",
        "God.",
        "Well, if you, - I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland, but, -",
        "Not at all.",
        "especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through it is really heavily populated. There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic.",
        "They don't even try to keep up with it.",
        "No.",
        "God.",
        "Not a bit.",
        "So you lived in Texas for a while.",
        "Yes sir.",
        "Huh.",
        "I spent, couple of years down there. Moved down there in eighty-seven and moved out in eighty-nine.",
        "Are, where you from originally.",
        "right here in Maryland.",
        "Hso you just basically went home when you had a chance.",
        "Yeah, my family, didn't like Texas, and I had a chance to, transfer up. T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in .",
        "That's nice.",
        "So I got an opportunity to transfer back, and I took it.",
        "God, that's great. I'm a native Texan.",
        
        "West Texan.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There is a difference.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I'm a West Texan.",
        
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A different world from down there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "Or so it seems. I may just be paranoid, but that state income tax is just eating me alive.",
        "Yeah, yeah, they have a state income tax in Maryland. But I noticed when I was in the, in the, in Texas, they didn't have a state income tax, but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and,",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "school taxes and property taxes,",
        "Property taxes and, -",
        "Oh my God, ate you alive.",
        "Yeah, well, Colorado, ins-, you know they have the state income tax, but then they also have property taxes, and they also have sales taxes, and they just get you every direction they can.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I just don't know, sir, but it seems like they trying to get you every which way.",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "I've heard of the book.",
        "Legally?",
        "Legally,",
        "Yes, yes,",
        "cut money on your taxes. Huh.",
        "legally, legally cut money on your taxes, and on your insurance, and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to, you know, be wealthier. he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet. Um, FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it. the man, has a lot of good ideas, some of them I already knew about, some of them I had already practiced. But I suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because, -",
        "And that includes everyone at T I.",
        "Yes, I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety-one. Yes.",
        "Well, even, the, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet.",
        "Yet.",
        "But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter.",
        
        "You know, survival is a funny state.",
        "Yeah, I know what you mean. I, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor, and I had four non exempts, um, under me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them. I just couldn't believe it.",
        "Did, well, I've been with the company for sixteen years now. I was a W F for several years, and it just n-, never seems to improve. It, and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twenty-eight or above.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "It's really a shame.",
        "Well, I, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very high payroll.",
        "Oh.",
        "And, the, you know, I thought I was making a good wage,",
        "so, you have children I take it?",
        "<noise> <<Sounds like she is cooking, i. e. banging pots, water, etc>> No, I don't.",
        "You don't?",
        "No, huh-uh.",
        "So, it's not a very valid topic.",
        "No, it's not. Do you have children?",
        "yes.",
        
        "One.",
        "One.",
        "Stepdaughter.",
        
        "Ten.",
        "Ten.",
        "And, you know how they are at that age, I guess.",
        
        "you having been ten once,",
        
        "yourself.",
        "Yeah. Once upon a time I was. Well, I have two dogs, those are my kids.",
        "Oh, we have one.",
        "What kind is it?",
        "A Keeshonden.",
        "Oh, really.",
        "Yeah,",
        "Uh-huh .",
        "fuzzy little thing.",
        "A what?",
        "A fuzzy little dog.",
        "Yeah, yeah, they're cute.",
        "Rather, rather odd personality, he, he's fun.",
        
        "Anyway, time we spend with our children.",
        
        "It seems almost as though children hate it.",
        "Do they?",
        "Yes.",
        "Time spent with Mom and Dad is, <noise> next, is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them.",
        "Yeah, especially when they get like into the teenage stage.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I guess. Yeah, I remember when I was that age.",
        "They, you know, - parents are a curse that they just have to live with.",
        "Uh-huh. <sniffing>",
        "<noise> So, it, it's interesting.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But we do spend time driving in the mountains, and ... -",
        "Uh-huh. Oh, how nice, I would love to live up there.",
        "Well. Do you work for T I? <noise>",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "You're working then?",
        "Yeah.",
        "With every passing day we wonder if we will be.",
        "That's what I heard. <noise> <<Sounds like running water>> I've always thought about maybe transferring up there, and I thought if I do that, I might not have a job so. <noise> -",
        "It's, it's better to be employed.",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner.",
        "Uh-huh. I know it.",
        "And that creates family tensions.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it does. <sniffing> So, you only have the, you only have the stepdaughter at home?",
        "Yes.",
        "You all don't have any other children around there?",
        "No, no.",
        
        "I don't have any, an-, children.",
        "Uh-huh. So, how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all.",
        "well it varies what it is, of course, but usually,",
        "<sniffing>",
        "Mom and Dad are a curse.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "You know, they, they'd much rather be with friends,",
        "Oh, yeah .",
        "friends are cool, parents aren't.",
        "No, huh-uh.",
        "Well, I remember, - well I'm sure part of it is a male, female thing, you know,",
        
        "I, I remember whenever I was growing up, often times spent with my Dad was, oh, just wonderful, you know, go, +",
        
        "go hunting, or go to the races,",
        
        "or, or, oh, any number of things.",
        
        "And we'd have, um, great times,",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "and it seems that well now the bank's not available.",
        "Yeah. Um.",
        "And, entirely too much time is spent, - my wife and I were wondering what if,",
        
        "and, and what if's always rough.",
        "Oh, yeah. Yeah.",
        "But, you know, we do have our trips and we do have our fun and,",
        
        "<sigh> I don't know, little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were.",
        "Like fishing and ... -",
        "Hunting and, and, ]",
        "Yeah.",
        "Looking for arrowheads, and ... -",
        "My husband will say that he'd like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing and I said, well, you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily.",
        "but they don't like it.",
        "That's probably right. <door>",
        "There, there, there is a difference there.",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "And, and ... -",
        "No, if my Dad had done that when I was a kid I probably wouldn't have liked it. I go now, with my husband. And, I enjoy it, but ... -",
        "Well, girls at that age,",
        
        "Video games, boys and malls.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Not necessarily in that order,",
        "and friends of course.",
        
        "And, that's a little tough for fathers.",
        "Uh-huh. I imagine.",
        "Fathers don't even like malls, they despise shopping.",
        "Uh.",
        "So, is that quality time?",
        "Hno, I think not.",
        "Yeah, if, - but there is camping and we both enjoy that.",
        "Uh-hshe likes to do that?",
        "Somewhat, yeah, yeah .",
        "Yeah , yeah. Well, that's good.",
        "Getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all and,",
        
        "that's somewhat fun.",
        "Uh-huh. She ... -",
        "It's , -",
        "Huh?",
        "so what do you think about child rearing? Is, - how, how would you spend time with kids?",
        "Probably doing outdoorsie stuff, and keeping, trying to keep them away from the T V, I guess. And, McDonald's.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I, I always said that if I had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is. <sniffing>",
        "Yeah, but -",
        "But , they learn from their friends, don't they?",
        "Well, yeah, and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy.",
        
        "You know, a lot of times, whenever we head out of town on a trip or something,",
        
        "it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Breakfast and run.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway,",
        "Yeah. It is.",
        "and, kids eat funny.",
        "This lady in our bass club, - we had a tournament yesterday and she was talking about her daughter, said, one week her daughter will, be on a no meat kick, and one week she'll eat nothing but Twix candy bars, you know, she just eats weird.",
        "And little girls are worse about it than little boys.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",

        "influence them,",
        
        "the eating meat kick.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something,",
        
        "I, I'm not sure.",
        "Of course, that's not the way I was raised, being raised in West Texas.",

        "Oh, yeah.",
        
        "Born in Denton, raised in Lubbock.",

        "Yeah. Huh.",
        "But it, but it is interesting,",
        
        "I, I will tell you, yeah. Every person out there should have kids, at least once or, or have some they can borrow for a time,",
        "That's the kind I like.",
        "because everyone needs some torture in their lives.",
        "My Mother used to put that curse on my sister. I hope you have kids just like yourself. And, my Grandmother must have put that on my Dad because he got my sister, she's just like him.",

        "Yeah, I'm sure she is.",
        "And, yeah, we do do things,",
        "Yeah.",

        "You know, Disney World or Disney Land.",
        
        "Well, our problem is that, you know, a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or, Disney Land, or God forbid, Disney World, would take forever.",
        "Really.",
        "Or you'd have to pay air fare,",
        
        "and, ooh, for a family, you know, for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick.",
        "OH, yeah.",
        "Rent a car when you get there and all that. Yeah.",
        "That's why I lucked out, my Dad worked for Braniff when I was a kid so we got, you know, our air fare free and we got ... <noise> -",
        "So, what kind of neat hobbies do you have?",
        "Well, I like gardening a lot, I like to be outside, um.",
        "I like gardening, I wish I had a green thumb, though.",
        
        "I've got a brown thumb. That's what everything turns.",
        "Oh, is, - but, do you tr-, keep trying anyway?",
        "I keep trying, you know, you just can't, can't give up on it, I, I bought some, plants from Michigan Bulb Company they send them to you all ready alive.",
        "No, no, I've never had any luck with their's.",
        "Oh really.",
        "Right.",
        "I guess, I guess these are going to croak too.",
        
        "Since I've got cats, I decided to get some catnip.",
        "Oh.",
        "Lots and lots of catnip, so it's, it's still green, and it's been two days so I'm encouraged.",
        "No, I, I haven't had, had good luck with that company, I think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail, probably.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, I've had to, to get my money back from them and had better luck with, with some of the, the more expensive companies.",
        "Yeah, there's a, -",
        "Because they, -",
        "I don't know, do you have Lowe's up there?",
        "well, -",
        "Its, building, contra-, or building supplies place.",
        "No.",
        "Um, they, they also have a garden shop and,",
        
        "they, they offer just as good a guarantee, if you buy it from them.",
        "Oh, that's great,",
        "Yeah.",
        "now our local stores don't, don't offer any guarantee.",
        "Um.",
        "But some of the, - the mail order ones that I've dealt with for roses and that, they offer through, through the first Summer.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Which - at least if they, if they take off the first year, they're probably going to come up unless there's, a terrible freeze or something.",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah, something like that. I got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff, so, I'm going to wait on those.",
        "Oh, they're bulbs for Spring or Fall?",
        "probably Spring, but, I don't much care about things like that. I'll, I'll make a little sort of greenhouse, a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in.",
        
        "Something, something, to keep me occupied, you see.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "I'll, buy some plastic and make a little house and, -",
        "Cute.",
        "yeah, and watch the cats tear it up.",
        "Right. I don't know that, do cats bother bulbs? I think more the mice or other rodents.",
        "They, they just like to get in and dig.",
        "Oh, I see so if you have fresh dirt, they'll, -",
        "Oh, they love to dig. I had, I had some, - I don't know what kind they are, I've already forgotten, - just regular old flower seeds and I planted them and I was so, I was so thrilled because they came up, I mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place. And then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that.",
        "gee.",
        "So, I have to hang these things high, so they can't get to them. Especially the catnip.",
        "How many cats do you have?",
        "Three.",
        "Oh okay.",
        
        "Actually I just, put a, little fence around my yard, um, which is I suppose, technically illegal, but I had so many groundhogs last year that I think they'll let me get by with it, and it, it's got this one inch mesh and what I've noticed it's kept the cats out and I love it.",
        "Um, yeah, yeah, because they, they like to get in and fertilize things too. But, why would it be illegal?",
        "Well, because we have these tow-, - I live in a townhouse and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission.",
        "Oh, yeah, right.",
        "And, you know, they want, privacy fences.",
        "Well, if nobody, yeah, if nobody complains you're all right.",
        "Right, right. Well they do walking tours too, so. -",
        "Um.",
        "But at least, because I back up to, um, a hillside where the, wild animals are, I think I can probably justify it.",
        "Um, yeah, an, and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway.",
        "Right, right, I me-, -",
        "You know, you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property.",
        "Right, the first year, the deer ate my garden, and I was just astounded. I'm going deer, right here in the city.",
        "Yeah, right here, Bambi.",
        "Exactly.",
        "gosh.",
        "And so, -",
        "Well, let's see, other than gardening which I fiddle at, I'm not very good at, - what else do I, mostly just computer stuff.",
        "Oh.",
        "I just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that. cooking, that's not really a hobby, it's a necessity.",
        
        "But, but I enjoy it. I like to think that I'm a very good cook.",
        "Oh, great.",
        "Um, hobbies, that's about it. I don't have much time for hobbies, between being a student and trying to run a business on the side, you don't have a lot of time.",
        "Right that keeps you busy.",
        "Yeah, and raising cats.",
        "I mean that could become a hobby.",
        "Well, it's, it started out as a hobby actually.",
        
        "it just, it developed into sort of a business, you know, we breed them and all that, but, we didn't, you know, we didn't really start it for the money, it was just, they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds an. And now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them, and, you know, all this kind of stuff.",
        "Uh-huh. What kind of cats are they?",
        "I've got a, a Bombay, a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian.",
        "Wow.",
        "Yeah, the Himie is probably the sweetest one. She's, she's just a little sweetheart.",
        
        "We, - the, the Bombay had a litter, last October and w-, - I just got her back from the vet this morning, getting her spayed. Only going to breed them once.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "And, she's not, she's not feeling too great today.",
        "Um, is that typical, to only breed them once?",
        "No, m-, most breeders are in it for the money, so they'll bree-, they'll breed them twice a year and I, +",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "I just think that it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of cruel. You know, they just, they just breed these, they breed them before they're ready, and,",
        "Right.",
        "you're never, you're never rea-, - and, and they, they do a lot of inbreeding too, and so you end up with, you know, kind of strange kittens.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "And I just don't like that.",
        "So will, you, breed one of the litter, then next year?",
        "We're, we sold all that litter,",
        "Oh.",
        "um, we, - there's not that much call to, for Bombays.",
        
        "Um, they're, they're registered but they're not, they're not, they're not show cats.",
        "Oh, I see.",
        "so all you can do is sell them as pet quality.",
        
        "so what you've got is a registered pet. And, not too many people want Bombays. They want things like Himie Persians and Turkish Vans.",
        
        "Turkish Vans, if you've never seen one, I mean, you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred. It's just, medium size short hair cat. It's got, - he's mostly white with, brown and black patches.",
        "Oh.",
        "But they have nice personalities and they're very inquisitive. Um, now the Himie, we'll probably breed her a couple of times and we'll, we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those.",
        "Right.",
        "It's just the stud fees are so much, though. It'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her. We, we want to breed her with a champion, so. -",
        "Right. Now these are long haired?",
        "Yeah, the Persian is,",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "and the other two are short hairs.",
        "Right. that's nice.",
        "Yeah, she's, she's sweet. Going to have some nice kittens, I hope.",
        
        "She's, she's, - if yo-, if you know what a Himalayan is, generally they look something like, - well they come in a lot of different colors. People don't realize it but they're sort of like, Siamese in a way. They have the, they have the gloves on the paws and they're, they're usually two colored. but this one is, is she's, pre-, predominantly, black but she has chocolate, paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters.",
        "Gee.",
        "And yeah, she's, she's quite attractive looking.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "Hope, hope the stud will find her attractive.",
        "And that she has kittens that look like her.",
        "And, and that she has a whole bunch of kittens. But we have to be careful, you know, we have to get a particular color point, stud. You can't just breed them with anything. We have to get a, we have to get a silver point Himie, so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens.",
        "I see.",
        "That's, it, that's the fun part, trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with, can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, you know.",
        "You can't just tell them that anyway, but. -",
        "That's right.",
        "Oh dear. Well it really sounds like, a business more than a hobby.",
        "Well actually, I mean, it, it is a business in a way, but it, it's a lot of fun as a hobby. Especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats. We're, we're about to get another breed, we're go-, we're going to buy a Devon Rex . And I didn't, I don't like Devon Rexes at first.",
        "What is it.",
        "It's a, well actually it's a mutant. It, it comes from England and, fr-, in the county of Devon.",
        "Oh.",
        "And it's a mutant cat. And they're, they're pretty expensive, we're going to, we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one. Um, they're very thin, they're, they're, they're long and lanky and skinny.",
        "Um.",
        "And they have real short hair. It's curly, as a matter of fact.",
        "Hinteresting.",
        "Um, yeah, it, it, it's a strange looking cat. I didn't like them at first. They've got great big ears,",
        "Okay. Well, ho-, how do you feel about, drug testing?",
        "Um, personally, I don't have a problem with it, I think, as far as, protecting fellow employees, protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do, um, it's justified. On the other hand, um, I do agree that it's, it's a, it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Um, I would never, I would never have a problem with anyone testing me, but I can understand why people would object. So, I guess, I guess, I'm kind of mixed on it,",
        "Yeah.",
        "still at this point.",
        "I am too a little bit, I mean, I, I don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing,",
        
        "and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, but I don't really like having to do it. It, -",
        "That's right.",
        "And I don't like the idea of it, it's, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing.",
        "That's absolutely right. It, it, I guess it all comes down to, you know, a, a definition of, how much out, outside activities affect your work and, granted, you know, that, - any, any kind of drug use on, on company property and whatnot,",
        "Yeah.",
        "is, is definitely not acceptable. I don't think anybody would ever argue that.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Or, any, any after affects carrying over into the workday but, um, you know, I don't, I'm not particularly concerned with what people do, um, after they leave for the day especially if I don't, if I don't, see any results of it the next day.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I think so too. But, you know, it's one of those things.",
        "Well, it, it is, it, you know, - on the other hand you, you've got, you've got the, the possibility of people, oh, - you've got some people could be arrested for, drug use, drug dealings and things like that, and, if their, if their employers name hits the papers and that it's, it's, +",
        "Yeah.",
        "it's a mark against them, the company and, you know, what kind of people work there, what, -",
        "Plus, I guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee,",
        "That's right. That's right.",
        "and their expertise or whatever.",
        "Right. E-, even if it is, you know, a company policy of, immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, there's, there's a lot involved there.",
        "Well, do you think that, um, it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it?",
        "I think, I think the regular schedule stuff, um, that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point, I never really thought of it that way.",
        "Well, you know, if, if they have time enough they can,",
        "Yeah, if they really can,",
        "stay off of it.",
        "um, I think the big-, the biggest problem I've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Um, as far as the new hires, I, I hired on just early enough that I, I missed it. Um, where the new hires were concerned but, not, nobody, no, I don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, I, I don't know, that, that's where I think that most people get upset. It's, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and, uh,",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's just, it, it's a really tough question and it, you know, it, - people have, have really quieted down after everything started but I still think there's a lot of, there's a lot of resentment.",
        "I think so too, I know the, the group I was in at the time this all came up they, were quite vocal about it, through electronic mail, boy, they just really,",
        
        "you know, let them have it from one end to the other,",
        "You bet.",
        "vehemently but, it has quieted down, but I don't think they probably feel any differently,",
        "No, that's right.",
        "and some, some of them did quit the company.",
        "Yeah, I, I know of some people who did, it was, it was indirectly related, you know, they could always come up with other reasons but it, it had a lot to do with it. Just the, the whole attitude, because it's really, it's just really, - it, it seems so un-, - T I, you know, with the, the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have,",
        "True.",
        "um, to all of a sudden, search for attitudes and whatnot. You know, there's not a lot of pressure to, to vote the right way or anything else around T I. Like there, like there is in some companies or at least, you know, - from what I've heard, -",
        
        "but, - yeah.",
        "Yeah, I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know,",
        "Uh-huh. No, I, -",
        "don't tell me what to do, you know.",
        "Absolutely not, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, - if you hired me I'll be, you know, - supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so, you know, let's, let's stick with that original trust, I guess.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, it's, it's still, it, it still remains a tough question and, it's, there's a lot of, you know, the whole, the whole department of defense, reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot. There's a lot of different things that, come into play but that was, - I think everybody, everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company.",
        "Yeah. Well, I guess too if I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing.",
        
        "But I think it's too minor and too, you know, - in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on,",
        "I really don't think so.",
        "what's going on in the street.",
        "Yeah. I really don't because, some people are going to, are, are going to risk it, um, it may prevent, e-, - I, I guess, I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if it, if it, if it does help a few individuals maybe, maybe it's worth it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Um, you know, it may prevent somebody who was, was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but, I don't know if, you know, the, - it's, it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation I don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much. There, there's still a big question in my mind that, the, the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of, of mistakes on the testing,",
        "Well, yes.",
        "is something that still bothers me. It, it's, -",
        "That, - yes. I, I think that could be a big problem, you know, I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,",
        
        "you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way.",
        "Uh-huh. Absolutely. And that, - I, I don't know if, I don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too. E-, even if you, you know, if you take, a, a drug that was presc-, prescribed for you but the, the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra penicillin, - well, penicillin's not on the list but, you know, -",
        "Yeah.",
        "yeah, I, I think you understand what I'm getting at,",
        "Yeah.",
        "it, it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and, +",
        "Right.",
        "and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent,",
        "No.",
        "and, those are the kinds of things that still can show up.",
        "I guess the one that really got me too was that, - let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is,",
        
        "and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine, that's not allowed.",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, that's, that's totally out.",
        "That's right. I even had friends when I was going to college who were in, pharmacy school and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family mens-, frie-, family members and friends certain medicines were, were legal now I, I, I believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists,",
        
        "but, um, there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and,",
        "Oh, that's interesting.",
        "that can happen. But, -",
        "Well, I guess we've exhausted that one.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I think so.",
        "enjoyed talking to you.",
        "You too.",
        "Good-bye.",
        "Good-bye.",
        "Well, what's your views on it?",
        "I think it's, a good idea. Um, I grew up, - my teenage years were spent during the sixties, graduating, high school in sixty-eight. Um, I remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about, and I thought it was a very good idea at the time. I was one of those, Kennedy children, if you know what I mean.",
        
        "And, right now I see a lot of kids who get out of school, have no idea what they want to do.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there's a lot of things out there that we could do, for our own country,",
        "Sure.",
        "let alone other countries,",
        "Sure.",
        "and I think that we've got the, the people power to do it, it's just, - we need to channel it and focus it on some things that, that need some fixing up. Um, ]",
        "Yeah.",
        "some examples are this, some of the things, like Jimmy Carter's been involved in, a little program to, you know, fix up housing for people.",
        
        "And there's a lot of housing,",
        "Yeah.",
        "a-, I know in the area that I live in, that's run down and beat up, but it could be fixed up and used,",
        
        "and it's just, you know, sitting there wasting away.",
        "Yeah, we're not too far behind <horn>. I graduated in seventy-one, so I'm, I'm same generation. I, I'm, - it's going to be a short conversation because I agree with you.",
        
        "I, I think, <horn> I don't, I don't even think it ought to be, voluntary, I think it ought to be mandatory. for kids to either, either do military service, or public service, one of the two. a lot of reasons for that, not, not just because I'm a, I'm a hard ass or anything.",
        
        "It's just that, like you say, kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do, and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus. And, I think that it might stop us some problems later on. I mean, you know y-, these kids will get their, their heads on straight, and, and figure out what they want to do, instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something. it's, I think it would be good for them, it helps mature them a little bit, and helps them understand the world, the way it really is.",
        "Yeah, I think a lot of people grow up with, with, preconceived notions li-, what the world's about.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "A lot of it has to do from too much T V,",
        "Oh, yeah, yeah.",
        "and, you know, it's, there's, there's a heck of a lot of difference between, you know, the intake that you get from T V and, and movies, and what you hear in school, and then what reality is.",
        
        "I remember, I've, I've worked since I was, - well, I started delivering papers when I was ten, and I had a real job when I was thirteen, so I've, you know, worked most of my life. But I remember when I got out of high school, all through high school was, - boy, I can't wait to get out of high school, I can't wait to get out of high school. And I wanted to go to college, and I had the grades to go to college, and I got accepted to college, but when I got out of high school, I kind of said, you know, what am I going to do now?",
        
        "You know, it's - like, you know, when I actually started working full time, and I, I got married shortly after getting out of high school. I, thought I was smart, ran away and got married,",
        
        "and, I remember there was a time, and within the first year of marriage, I said, boy wouldn't I give to get, be back in school,",
        
        "and just have to do homework, and, and go work my part time job.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Because, life, and the reality of working for a living, and trying to make ends meet, is just so overwhelming to someone,",
        "Yeah.",
        "if they aren't prepared for it.",
        "And, and most of them aren't.",
        "That's true.",
        "I mean, you look, you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right ou-, I mean, even in high school, and, you know, y-, you wonder, where are the parents in all of this. You know, why isn't somebody stepping in and, and sto-, putting a stop to this. Kids in high school are just too young to be married.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They ha-, they have no idea what the world is like. They don't how tough it is out there to make a living.",
        "Yeah, a, -",
        "I mean, I was in the same boat when I left high school. I, my parents wanted me to go straight to college and I didn't. You know, I was ready, I was ready, I had wanderlust, I wanted to get out and see some things. So, I joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years.",
        "Um.",
        "Um, but, I had lived in my own little bubble up until that time, and, and after traveling around the world a few times, I realized that, things ain't the way they seem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I, I did a lot of growing up there, uh,",
        "Yeah, I think once, once kids get out and see how other people really live,",
        "Uh-huh. Yeah.",
        "and know how bad off some people really are, and how good they've got it,",
        "That's right.",
        "and what it takes to have that good life,",
        "That's right.",
        "a-, if you're willing to work for it,",
        
        "then they're probably be more inclined to work for it.",
        "Well, you know, it's just like you say, there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country, and, you know, if, if you could have a thought of something like, like a, a Peace Corps sort of organization. I mean, this would be so useful, just in, for instance, just helping old folks.",
        "Uh-hexactly.",
        "You know, they, you know they need help, they don't have anybody to depend on, and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house, or do minor repairs, or something like that. Y-, -",
        "You know, I've, I've s-, I, - my, my parents are in their late sixties now, and, um, so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, it's, it's really hard on them, and the, you know, the thought that I, I see the, the mall rats, you know, walking around the mall, nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long, when they could be doing something to help someone. -",
        "Uh-huh. Yeah.",
        "And, you know, yo-, there's a, a nice warm feeling, I remember getting out of doing things like that when I was younger,",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I was a Boy Scout and the whole bit and, -",
        "Yeah, my mom's in the same position, late sixties, and, and it got to the, got to the point where, I mean, me and my brother both were, were gone, and she couldn't maintain the house, without large expenditures of money.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment. And, I, I'm not, I'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway, but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things. You know, like the, like the yard work and little repairs, and painting and stuff like that.",
        "Yeah. I think there'd, there'd be a, you know, a, economic benefit for, you know, everyone concerned,",
        "Oh yeah, sure.",
        "those doing the work, and those receiving the, the, the services.",
        "Sure, I mean, I mean, the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, that, - I, I remember when I was a kid, I used to do little, little things for the old folks around the neighborhood, and, I know how it made me feel. You know, you s-, - peop-, people just don't help people anymore. They're, they're out for themselves and, -",
        "Yeah. I think, President",
        "Yeah, well that's, that's the, that's the point we've gotten to, you know. Every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government. And, y-, the government's going to be limited. I, where are they going to get the money? They're going to get it from us. And we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Um, the thing that Carter works on, Habitats For Humanity, I was involved in that w-, in Montgomery, before I came up to North Carolina,",
        
        "and, it was, it was a pretty neat little program. We'd just go out, and they would buy a plot of land, and contractors and builders, and everybody else would donate their, their time, and, the materials were at cost. And we'd put up houses. And, that was kind, that was kind of neat. I, in a way, I think it's a little bit inefficient, but, but it's better than nothing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, and at least I had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing. Um, course, on the other hand, I can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves, but just won't.",
        "Yes.",
        "Because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw, welfare money than it is to work. we did a, a cost comparison in one of my courses, and we took all the benefits that a family, that a, a married couple with two kids would get under welfare, and what they would be making at minimum wage. And they came out four thousand dollars better a year, by taking welfare.",
        "Yes.",
        "So there's no incentive for them to do anything. Far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money.",
        "Yeah. One of the things they tried to push through in Maryland, and, weren't very successful was that if you were an able-bodied person on welfare,",
        "You had to do something.",
        "you had to do some work. And, -",
        "Yeah. A-, an-, and that's been tried, that was tried in Alabama too, and it got shot down.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I d-, and I don't understand the reasoning for it. I really don't. It, it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money, then they should return something to the public. I mean, if nothing else, go out along an interstate and pick up garbage.",
        "That's exactly what they were trying to get them to do.",
        "Yeah. What do they, what do they do in Maryland, do they use highway people or do they use prisoners?",
        "Um, both.",
        "Yeah. Tha-, that's the way they did it in Alabama, too.",
        "Yeah, they use both.",
        "U-, usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there, picking up trash.",
        "they have a, they have another program in Maryland that's called Adopt",
        "Uh-huh-huh. Yeah, we have that here in North Carolina.",
        "So, do you fish?",
        "Oh, yeah. My dad has a lake cabin, and so we go there for the small lake, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area. It takes us about three hours to get there. And we go, and we fish, and we catch a bunch of junk. Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part, but it's fun.",
        "from a boat or from shore?",
        "From the dock, from shore.",
        "Oh, that's nice. mostly catfish or, -",
        "Oh, mostly we catch carp. If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while. And, you know, we go ahead and eat those. But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry. What we normally do is just, go ahead and clean it up, and then, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it. And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd. Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there, so we don't ever catch enough to eat. Carp is usually pretty much fun. Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line. And that, that's a pretty good fight. So that's a lot of fun.",
        "Yeah. A real light line, real light rig?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, that sounds like fun.",
        "They fight hard.",
        "Fish in Colorado s-, different than that.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Mostly trout in the mountains.",
        "Yeah, and in the rivers and stuff?",
        "Yeah, yeah, mountain streams and rivers.",
        "Are they good to eat?",
        "yeah, very. Yeah, very much there, you know.",
        "Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big?",
        "Um, by and large, no. But, but they're big fun.",
        "Yeah. Well, I've been, - is that mostly, fly fishing when you're doing that or, -",
        "What?",
        "Are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber?",
        "I, I, I'm a fly fisherman.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, I, I cast a ways. I'm not highly proficient, but it's fun.",
        "I've never even tried that. My, - if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble.",
        "Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then. You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?",
        
        "You're casting the weight of the line.",
        "With the little thing on the end.",
        "Yeah, well,",
        "Yeah, I thought it had a weight.",
        "the fly on the end weighs nothing. It weighs less than the line.",
        "Oh.",
        "So what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.",
        
        "And you whip the line.",
        "Um.",
        "As you whip it, over your head,",
        
        "or side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.",
        "Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some?",
        "Well, no, no. You fish upstream.",
        "Oh, you fish upstream?",
        "Right. And then you let it carry it downstream.",
        
        "And then you reel it in, and you do it again.",
        "You hope that they think it's a bug and, +",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "and eat it.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Jump at it. from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.",
        "That's a fish?",
        "No, no. It, it looks like a grub. Yeah.",
        "Oh, it's a, it's a lure.",
        "Okay, whenever you, - yeah, a lure, a fly.",
        "I see.",
        
        "Oh.",
        
        "Um.",
        "Uh,",
        "Did someone just come up with this design, and, and you're going to make one for yourself,",
        "Uh,",
        "or are you going to buy it?",
        "You can buy them. I've got some. And,",
        
        "They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall.",
        "Oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year, huh?",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Um.",
        "You know how that changes, the phase of the moon and, -",
        "I guess so. We tend to use just bait.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I, I, +",
        "And, a few lures, but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.",
        "You see, I'm from west Texas.",
        "Oh, are you?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Where are you from?",
        "Lubbock.",
        "Oh, I'm from Midland.",
        "Oh, another west Texan.",
        "I went to college at Tech, so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Yeah. I've been up there.",
        "It, +",
        "I didn't catch anything, but I've been up there.",
        "It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day.",
        "Yeah, it's fun. It's lazy. Take a picnic lunch. I used to do that with my dad. Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Before it got too hot.",
        "Well, there you fish mornings and evenings.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And nights.",
        "Yeah, we do most of our fishing at night.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Just from the heat of it all. That's one advantage you've certainly got on us.",
        "It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.",
        "It does? I've only been up there once. In the summer. Well, no, I've been up there twice in the summer. But both times it was really pleasant. In fact, it snowed on us in, in, - gosh, when was that?",
        "June?",
        "We were in Mesa Verde Park, and it was like the end of Ju-. It was just before July fourth.",
        "Oh.",
        "And it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees. We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better. And here it went and it froze, and it snowed on us.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We did not know what to do about it.",
        "Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water. It's, it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and,",
        "Yeah.",
        "hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and,",
        
        "seeing the squirrels and,",
        "Do, +",
        "camping out, and eating out,",
        "Yeah.",
        "of doors and, -",
        "Do you have to, do you wear waders when you fish?",
        "I probably ought to. I just freeze.",
        "Oh. Goodness, it must be a little bit cold.",
        "Yeah, yeah, well, you know,",
        "That's cold water around there.",
        "ankle deep or standing on the bank, and slipping it out there.",
        "Um. Do you have any, -",
        "You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it,",
        "Oh, I see.",
        "out there, and you know how it is. The water's kind of, -",
        "Yeah. And you get, you get a little more carried away with it, and you move a little closer.",
        "And then you're in to it just a little bit, and then you splash in and,",
        "Yeah.",
        "the next thing you know, your knees are wet.",
        "Do you have any kids that you take fishing?",
        "got a stepdaughter.",
        
        "She's real sweet. And, at times she enjoys it, at times not.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A fuzzy little dog.",
        "I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.",
        "Oh.",
        "And the little one, of course, is, could care less.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point, - we got him a little pole last year, and just put, - his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up. That was what he considered fishing. This year, he's gotten to where he can. We, we were at a friend's, stock pond, we were out at their farm, and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal-, we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And he started trying to cast it. So, he, he was kind of getting there but he's, +",
        "Yeah, you guys sure want to be out of range.",
        "He's at a dangerous point right now. He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.",
        "It takes time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. Last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time. And we still had a good time out,",
        "Yeah.",
        "of the deal.",
        "Well, that's good.",
        "and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.",
        "Oh, yeah. My husband would like to live there, but I don't know. All of our family is here so, -",
        "Well, and you've got to have, you've got to work for a living.",
        "Well, yeah, but T I is up there, so that part of it would probably work out <static> <noise>.",
        "What division you all in?",
        "I'm sorry, what?",
        "What division are you all in?",
        "We're both, - I was, military, but he's division three. It goes back and forth. Division, well, maybe division one right now. He's in computers.",
        "Oh.",
        "So, -",
        "Well, the only thing up here,",
        "And he's in school,",
        "is division one.",
        "and everything else. I have some friends who work up there.",
        "Oh, yeah?",
        "Kathy and Kevin Guy.",
        "Okay. Yeah.",
        "Yeah. And they like to fish. They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer. Her dad has a cabin, and they go fishing, up there.",
        "Oh, fishing's, +",
        "So that would be neat to,",
        "fishing is fun up here. It's not, -",
        "try it some time.",
        "It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there. But <sigh> it is fun.",
        "Yeah,",
        "You know,",
        "long as you have a good time, that's the main point so, -",
        "The, the experience is, is better up here, I think.",
        
        "You know, it seems more relaxing, there's <static> more to look at.",
        "Definitely more to look at.",
        "And, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul <static>.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake, -",
        "Yeah. The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up. We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago. And we figured we were up a long way off. And then it rained that night, and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are? And we got up the next day, and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away.",
        
        "And it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch. So, that was kind of funny.",
        "Yeah, it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.",
        "Yeah, I just love the way it looks. I could almost just watch the wa-, - we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much, and if you were there. I mean, it was, - one time we were there, and I guess it was late May, so it was really your spring almost,",
        
        "you know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here. And, and the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt, and the creek was just wild, just running. And, and all the white water and noise and the, - it was just beautiful.",
        "Yeah. I-, it gets f-, foamy almost.",
        
        "And you know it's just pure and pristine.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And the froth and, -",
        "Well thanks for being home, on the weekend, I, I'm actually working at night and, there very few people that are on the list for calls, on the weekends nights.",
        "Uh-hyeah, well sometimes I'm home and sometimes I'm not, but if I am it's always fun to talk.",
        "Are, are you part of the school system out there?",
        "I am, as a matter of fact. I'm at, North Carolina State.",
        "the reason I said that because I've had about, three calls and my daughter had one, too, from different students out of North Carolina. I guess they pass the names amongst your computer students, or whatever.",
        "Yeah, I think I was the one who did that actually.",
        "Oh is that ri-, - great, great.",
        "Yeah, I had a, - I teach a course in Voice I O Systems.",
        "Oh, is that right? That's wonderful.",
        "So, I know, you know, I know about this project, so I got my students to sign up and, apparently a number of them have been participating.",
        "Oh, yeah, I talked to one, we're not on the subject. Of course, I talked to one, I think he had a whole bunch of calls. He had a roommate that had calls and everything.",
        
        "He had way more, twice as many calls as, as I've made, and I, I'm, - of course, we at T I just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will, sell like gang books, bu-, busters, really.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay, you first on the subject, wha-, what do you think, about Latin",
        "let's see, the subject is, Latin America.",
        "Latin America, yeah.",
        "I don't know whether I have any real profound thoughts about that, I actually wa-, was planning a trip to Latin America and I got warned off by some people. They say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth.",
        "Oh, really. T I had a place, I'm not too sure, I don't think they do anymore, down, - I think it was Campinas, I'm not sure and, I guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry, or whatever. And they had quite a few, locations, not quite a few, several, in Latin America. I think the one in New Mexico is closed and I think the one in, in Brazil is closed, but I, I don't know why that is a problem down there and I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and, an some people say go to New York, but I don't, I don't have an answer to the crime rate. It's sad. That is a sad situation. I, I'd like to go down to Mexico, you know, and I keep hearing that, you know, the government and, and the crime rates pretty high too, that, that is sad.",
        "Yeah.",
        "not that we can, sell any great program we have with crime, but, uh. I think, I'm kind of like you, I don't have any strong opinions on it. I guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our, our neighbors down there is that we don't have any. We have more, I guess ties, we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really, aren't that close to everyone in South America. I don't really know why though.",
        "Yeah, I, I don't understand it either, although I, I think a lot of South",
        "Right.",
        "I mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking, in, in his wildest dreams from his neighbors.",
        "Right. Yeah, I know that I saw in a book, - I was reading a Spanish book, - not that I read Spanish, you know, I just, you know, reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say, we're Americans. They would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too, you know, and I guess that's true. We don't think of any one else but oursel-, - I guess, we're kind of, the smart asses in the world, I suppose, or of America anyway. We think of ourselves as the only Americans, when they're Americans, too.",
        "Yeah, well I think they're going to have, - that's a tough row for <noise> them to, to hoe because I think most of the world is going to regard, citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans.",
        "As Mexicans, yes that, that, -",
        "And they can stand on their heads if they want too,",
        
        "but I don't think that they're going, they're going to change that, and, +",
        "No, no, I know.",
        "and, and really, I mean North Americans I think are, - when you say that even, I thi-, I mean, I tend to think of Americans and Canadians. I just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans, although, I guess, strictly speaking they are.",
        "Yeah, no, I mean they were saying that of us, that we're the North",
        "Oh, I see.",
        "We're not Americans, we're North Americans and they're South Americans, yeah.",
        "I don't know.",
        "Whatever, I, I don't want to make, - I read it somewhere, though it's not my point, I guess, so. -",
        "Yeah, well it's, it's so interesting, I ju-, I just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics.",
        "No, no, they, they were lucky enough to have some oil, what, ten years ago, an, and they, they blew all that, and borrowed enou-, more money than they can pay back now and, so they're not exactly business men. I do think we should deal more with them. I don't, I do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas, for the language, you know, is very foolish. I'm relativ-, relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in, grammar school, you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish. I think that helps, when you certainly can speak their language, and there are problems with, you know, the wet back problem, you know, for, everyone knows what we're talking about, whe-, say wet back problem. And then we should somehow, - and I think the governments are working on that, to try to have some, businesses, at the borders of both sides so that you can, you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here an, to, to get the jobs, you know, there, there may be some organized way to do this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I, I do feel for them, they are very envious of us, or they wouldn't be coming up here, you know, risking a lot. Not that they're risking their lives, of course, but risking a lot, getting thrown back I guess is all that, happens.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You probably don't see that. Where, we see it, you know, once a month. I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that.",
        "Well I grew up in Los Angeles.",
        "Okay, well you see it, saw it out there then, too.",
        "And, in fact, I drove a cab when I was a graduate student so I, I knew, the Hispanic part of L A pretty well.",
        
        "And certainly, you know, knew that problem, knew, you know, knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them, sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, it was, it was pretty wild.",
        "I think a, a common factor to a lot of problems, both, whether it be crime, if, if you want to jump on that, is mostly, poverty. and I think a lot of their problems is poverty. If we could, - the problems we have, yo-, kno-, in this country, is, is a lot of it's poverty. Whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty, I, that's another story, but, it is sad. There, there's so much down in all of South",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there's got to be trade. I guess that's some of the answer, I guess is business, uh. and I try to be an optimist and say, well that, that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime, or certainly poverty obviously is to, is to get some business going between each other. And we need, we need to do more of that, somehow. And encourage more business,",
        "Yeah.",
        "between us.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They've got to have a lot of resources I would think. An enormous amount of, of well potential that way. A lot of it, of course is hot and jungle and all that, but, there's got to be a lot of potential down there.",
        "Yeah, uh,",
        "Wha-, what are you taking in school,",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "I didn't ask you that. What are you taking in school?",
        "Well I am actually, -",
        "Oh, yo-, you're an instructor,",
        "Yeah.",
        "yeah, you're an instructor, yeah, you said.",
        "Yeah, I'm the, I'm the teacher, I give, as it were.",
        "That's great. Are you teaching Computer Science? Wha-, you said, what were you saying you were teaching there?",
        "Yeah, I'm in Computer Science and,",
        "Great, great.",
        "very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition, but of course, this project is really one to collect a data base of, of, of casual speech, in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like.",
        "Right. I, of course, I work at T I and I'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time, why that isn't enough. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm getting a kick out of the whole program but, there's going to be I guess thousands, I don't know how many thousands, or tens of thousands of these recordings and I wonder how they're going to analyze them. Whether it would be listening to them or analyzing, I gu-, - they've got to be analyzing with a, a voice recorder some how.",
        "Yeah, well they record these and then somebody transcribes them so that they, +",
        
        "they have, they have a speech signal and what, and what is said.",
        "Right.",
        "And they have a, they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening and that's, a big problem in speech recognition.",
        "Oh, yes. I know they change with age, I know mine changes, has changed, - although you, you never found, - your, your voice echoes in your own head which is, makes it different than what it really sounds to other people.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'm sure singers and professional people know that, and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say, my God, that's, that's not, obviously that's not me, you know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, I know your voice in your own head resonates a different way. go ahead, yo-, you comment on it, yeah, I'm glad that you're in the business. That, - I kno-, - T I -s gotten with their Speak and Spell and everything, - I've told my wife, that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer,",
        "Right.",
        "you wouldn't have to have a keyboard,",
        
        "you'll be able to just give it commands and I'm sure they have some of that now, and not, not, in computers but a lot of potential, of course for handicapped people, -",
        "So, what do you think?.",
        "I think we're overtaxed to the hilt.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, I mean, we're, we're taxed on taxes and, um, most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have it that is. I mean we don't have one yet, but eventually they may try to push it through.",
        "Oh really. So they have n-, I didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas.",
        "No, no state income tax.",
        "Oh, that's great, because they don't have it in Florida. In New York they have it.",
        
        "I mean, you know, like I say, I'm in New York and we have a state tax as well. So that just cuts even more.",
        "Yeah, I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits.",
        "Right, I, I think that I, I mean, I wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't, they don't go to any place. You know, y-, you don't see it going to any place where it belongs.",
        "Right.",
        "I think if it were to be, if it were to be, um, if it were to be, <whispering> hold, hold on a second please, someone just walked in the ro-,",
        "Yeah.",
        "<Rattling> If, if it were to be spent in the right way I think I wouldn't be so upset about it, but given that it, that it's not spent properly, I think it's a major problem.",
        "Well we're really overburdened from federal, state and local,",
        "Uh-huh <<softly>>.",
        "that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck.",
        "Well that's certainly true. Well what is it they were just talking about, um, sort of middle income, you know, how, how, middle income people, - what winds up happening is, for instance having kids, you know, they wind up having kids as a deduction and after, - but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something.",
        
        "I think tha-, - so they want to, you know try an-, - I think they're trying, I think tha-, I think that most of the politicians understand this. They just don't, they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing.",
        "Well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well.",
        "Right.",
        "And, I think the only way that can be changed for us to get a, a better tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms.",
        
        "And by doing so, they're not obligated to anybody.",
        "I agree, I agree.",
        "And, I don't know how we're going to do that right away though, but, what, what in general though that taxes are doing to us is, it's just taking, a bite out of our savings.",
        "Right, exactly, and then, and then, I'm, I'm just not sure if I see, you know, if I see it going, like I say to the right places. I mean, it'd be, it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, but I'm not convinced, that's, a-, tha-, that Social Security is doing as well as it should [ and, you know, and, and, and, and, and that, you know, those people who need it for welfare and so forth, who really need it for welfare, not the eighty-five to ninety percent of them who don't need it. But I mean the real people who really need it, you know, should be getting it but instead I think it's going to the wrong places.",
        "And I believe the Social Security tax is a great scheme.",
        "You think so?",
        "Yeah, it's, you know, - right now, they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit.",
        "I know and that scares the hell out of me.",
        "Yeah, tha-, that's illegal, see. If, most company, C E O -s were to do that within their private company, they'd be in jail.",
        "Yeah <door>.",
        "So how are we letting them get away with it.",
        "Yeah, I don't, I don't, - well becau-, because they're the ones who make the laws.",
        "Right.",
        "So who's going to yell at them, you know, it'd be nice if we sort of, as one, band together and, and, and, an performed a citizens arrest, I guess.",
        "Yeah.",
        "To see if we could sort of clean them up and you know, but I don't know if we can do that or not.",
        "A lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on,",
        
        "in the taxing system.",
        "I agree, I agree. But, um, yeah, like, like you said, I wonder, you know, if, if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and I wonder if it'll ever be a change process.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I sort of, I sort of get discouraged when I think about all the things that I think are wrong. You know, all those things that really could be changed that aren't, you know, that, that aren't. And tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list.",
        "Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "So, I don't kno-, - I, I, I have no idea what to do about it.",
        "Well there's no quick solution, or no sure fire easy answer. It's just going to take, really, a combination effort, I think, of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer,",
        "<Door>.",
        "or vote to limit the way it's spent.",
        "Yeah.",
        "See, we, we're, we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place.",
        "Right. We don't, - I mean, the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another.",
        "Right and they are controlled, or pretty much do what they want to do.",
        "Right, I've never quite understood that. I've never, you know, even though, um, I, I've never been, sort of politically minded, - but it's never been clear to me as to sort of, um, you know, how Congressmen an, can, can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency doe-, doesn't back them up on anything, you know. And often times that will happen.",
        "Well they feel invu-, invulnerable to, any wrath or,",
        "Right <clicking>.",
        "it's, it's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises.",
        "Right.",
        "And generally it does work out that way.",
        "They do forget, it's true, coul-, because everybody, - think of what happens is whenever the politici-, whenever th-, the one who made that supposed mistake turns around - and, his, his or her opponent can say well look, they did this. And they can turn around and say well my opponent did this.",
        
        "So it becomes, a general battle of the w-, sort of the election of the lesser of two evils, I think, so.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't know, I just, I'm unhappy with it but. - And well, I'm, I'm sort of semifortunate right now, I'm a graduate student, so I don't make that much,",
        
        "and what I make isn't taxed very highly because I'm still in school.",
        "Well when you get out into the real world then you'll know.",
        "But it's, my, my, my wife has a real job and, you know, when I get her job, um, you know, we, we look at her paycheck, I'm just floored when I see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep.",
        "Yeah.",
        "<Door> Especially around bonus time.",
        "Bonus time, you have a bonus?",
        "Bonus, she, - no, my, my wife does.",
        "Oh.",
        "My wi-, - I don-, - no graduate students don't get bonuses.",
        
        "We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure.",
        "So you're taxed on the bonuses too, right.",
        "My, my wife is taxed on her bonus as well, and that's a, that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually.",
        
        "I mean her bonus isn't that much, but they tax it as, - I, I guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something.",
        
        "So she gets destroyed on her bonus check.",
        
        "So, she works with in, in, in sales. So a good portion of her, you know, her salary is, is quarterly bonuses.",
        "sales is lucrative but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job.",
        "Yes, well, yeah, she's not entirely sales, so it isn't, it isn't as lucrative as one would hope, but, it, it keeps us supported temporarily,",
        
        "until I can get a real salary and then get taxed more. So, I don't know, I d-, I guess, I guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it, and hope that it gets better <door>.",
        "Yeah. Well, I have, I guess about said what a-, all I can think of to say.",
        "Same here, tough topic so. -",
        "Yeah, it's re-, a rather touchy topic at that, but. -",
        "I beli-, - I, I, I do agree with you, most, most wholeheartedly.",
        "Well that's great.",
        "It's been a pleasure talking with you.",
        "You too, and, -",
        "Thanks for call.",
        "have a good day.",
        "You too. Bye-bye.",
        "Okay. I'll let you go ahead.",
        "Okay. I, I have five children all together.",
        "Oh, uh-huh.",
        "Oh.",
        "That's great. I always thought it'd be great to have twins.",
        "yeah. If you like doing everything twice.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "at any rate, um, my first two children, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them.",
        
        "Um, <smack> and, you know, was a, a problem with having five children needing to work a, a full-time job that,",
        
        "was more than a full-time job. I,",
        
        "worked about fifty-one hours a week, because I worked every, worked eleven hours every Sunday.",
        
        "And, so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I, as I should have, as I really wanted to.",
        "Your first ones you mean, it,",
        "Yeah. The, +",
        "was this way?",
        "yeah, the f-, - well, it was with all of them,",
        
        "but it was, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two.",
        
        "Because, um, <noise> oh, about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the, <noise> when the twins were about three years old. And, they never, you know, I don't think they noticed I wasn't around that much.",
        "Oh.",
        "You know, with all the children around the house, it's,",
        "Right.",
        "kind of hard to notice that Dad isn't around,",
        
        "very much. <noise> Um, <smack> so, what I've tried to do, now that I've, fi-, - went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old.",
        
        "And, so, then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty-one hours,",
        
        "a week. So, I've tried to spend more time with, the children since then.",
        
        "Um, what I'm currently doing is, taking a lot of time. I'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings. Um, we just started a thing where every other week we go to, movies. There's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights.",
        
        "And so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the,",
        
        "movies. And, it's working out pretty well. Um, we're spending more time together. I feel like I'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than I ever was to the two that were living there before.",
        
        "Um, in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with, - I have one son who's gone and I don't even know where he's at.",
        "Huh.",
        "Um, he's taken off for parts unknown,",
        "That's difficult.",
        "but, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A-, and, my daughter is, um, <smack> has moved out of the house. Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house.",
        "Uh-huh. It happens that way.",
        "And so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time, and I think it's important that we do, because, <smack> I notice that, when I had spent two years down in Dallas, down there they all have a, a me kind of attitude.",
        
        "And I noticed parents not spending time with their,",
        
        "children and, and going out and doing things. And, you know, I knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and,",
        "Um, uh-huh.",
        "you know, it just, you know, - I saw the family falling apart down,",
        "Texas is,",
        "there.",
        "much worst for the drugs. I mean, it was bad enough every place else, but drugs is, in Texas, are extremely bad.",
        "<Smack> Yeah. And so, I think it's kind of important that I, that I, you know, nurture the relationship I have with my children now.",
        
        
        "Well, that's all you can do.",
        "Yeah. What's your, been your experience?",
        "Well, I, I was going to ask, too, does your wife work?",
        "Um, she didn't up until the last, oh, six months.",
        
        "Um. A.73",
        "<Smack> She just recently,",
        
        "started working. she worked a job until we moved to our new house and, she quit that job because it was too inconvenient. And,",
        
        "she starts a new job tomorrow, which should take her out of the house about four days a week.",
        "Oh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. So, that sounds great. <smack> Well, <smack> we also have five children.",
        "Huh.",
        "And, but ours are all out of the nest.",
        
        "So, as, when they were growing up, I, probably we had a lot of similar things l-, like you had, you know, having the time. When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, we were, we're very active, of course, at church, and, Boy Scouting, and Girl Scouts, Four H, and those activities helped a lot in,",
        
        "giving us things to do with the children. And we try to take a vacation with them every year, camping of some sort, something that wasn't expensive. And, our youngest is, expecting her first baby. So, they're, they're all out and on their own. <noise> They're, - and we have one to get married yet. And they'll all be married. and they're, they're all doing pretty good. They, - T lives in Pittsburgh, you probably don't know where that is.",
        "Certainly do.",
        "Okay. Two of our children live there. one, I, like I said, lives near Maryl-, in, in around Maryland, D C. He works right on the border of D C.",
        
        "And one lives in Connecticut <<tape skips on Speaker A's section>> and our baby lives just a mile over the hill,",
        
        "so, we'll get to see her a little more than, what we do the other ones.",
        "Yeah. That sounds great. I've, I've noticed, another thing, um, <smack> when I was younger my father was always working.",
        "Uh-huh. Well,",
        "And, -",
        "they have to.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, he, he worked a full-time job and a part-time job,",
        
        "and I never saw him.",
        
        "So, I didn't have much of a role model to go by.",
        "To go, to follow.",
        "You,",
        
        "know, to learn how to be a, a father and,",
        
        "a parent, and that kind of thing, because,",
        "Yeah.",
        "I, I can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or,",
        
        "catch with my dad, or doing anything with my dad.",
        "And that does make a big difference.",
        
        
        "You know, everybody's not FATHER KNOWS BEST.",
        
        "Yeah,",
        "That's, +",
        "but, -",
        "that's, - well none of us are. Let's face it,",
        "Yeah.",
        "you know, we're not none of us like they pro-, portray it on those shows. I mean,",
        "Yeah.",
        "life's much more difficult than that.",
        "Yeah. I,",
        "And, -",
        "mean, the, the, the capability to, create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the, the mental capacity to raise them.",
        "Right. Right.",
        "And, -",
        "Now, our daughter, our, - well, she's our second oldest, she has, she's the only that, other one that has children. She has two boys. And, she works full time and I have mixed feelings about that. She's able to do that and I don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home. But, yet, on the other hand, I, I've got the mixed feelings that I think you should be at home with your children. I'm kind of old fashioned, I guess, that way.",
        "Yes.",
        "But they seem to, they seem to give, quality time to those children when they are together. And, and so, it seems, <noise> it seems for them that it works out all right. So, I don't know. I, I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family. So ,",
        "Yes.",
        "I , -",
        "It's, it's not easy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I've, you know, I've helped out extremely, - well, I can't say <noise> that, but I've helped out,",
        
        "as best I could at home.",
        
        "And, y-, as you know, with five children it takes a lot of work.",
        "Yes. It does,",
        "Even,",
        "it, it, - yeah.",
        "if, even if someone's home all the time, there's still a lot of things that have to be done.",
        "Yeah. What line of work are you in now since you went to school and, -",
        "well, now I work for Texas Instruments.",
        "Oh,",
        "So, +",
        "okay.",
        "so, I'm in computers.",
        "Okay. A lot of the people I've, that's call-, I've talked to work for, for the same.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh.",
        "And so, I've, - prior to that I, I worked in a food store.",
        
        "And, you know, wor-, -",
        "Which your income would be a lot better,",
        "Uh,",
        "now.",
        "right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. It, it was, it was a, a smart move to make.",
        
        "Um,",
        
        "I was more intelligent than the position I was holding.",
        "Right.",
        "And, uh,",
        "And it's,",
        "it was, -",
        "kind of a waste of a person.",
        "Yes. I, I, ]",
        "You know.",
        "felt that it certainly was, I mean,",
        
        "I was smarter than most of the people that I was working for.",
        
        "And, you know, every time something new came up, I was explaining it to them.",
        
        "And,",
        
        "I,",
        "And you, +",
        "had, -",
        "you recognized this and,",
        "No.",
        "was able to, you know,",
        "Yeah. I, -",
        "do something about it.",
        
        "Well, it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, the only thing you can remember is to <<tape skips>> try and stay together as much as you can,",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. Well, it, it all paid off.",
        "Well, that's wonderful.",
        "Uh-huh .",
        "Uh-huh. It sounds to me like, you're doing well. My husband's retired, so, he's been retired for three years now.",
        
        "Yeah. That's quite a change.",
        "Yeah, well, my goal is to try to retire by the time I'm fifty-five.",
        "Oh, well, he made it at fifty.",
        "Great.",
        "It was a magic number for him and, and, he went at fifty, and he still works part time at other thing, you know, same job as he was doing, only he's retired and doing it independently.",
        
        "But, nevertheless retired.",
        "Well, I'm <<fade out>>. -",
        "So eating out. What are you interested in in restaurants?",
        "Right, uh. We eat out quite a bit, it's just my husband and I at home now. So. -",
        "once a week, twice a week?",
        "Oh, at least once a week. We're, we're retired now. When we working out we ate out more than that.",
        "Yeah, I understand.",
        "Uh.",
        "but we both work and we have a daughter, and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway.",
        "Uh-huh. Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard?",
        "really, I'm kind of open on food. I'm what you might call a culinary adventurer. I'll,",
        
        "try anything once.",
        "Right.",
        "Been on a real barbecue kick lately.",
        "Oh have you?",
        "Yeah.",
        "We like Chinese. We eat,",
        "<Cough>.",
        "a lot of Chinese food.",
        "Excuse me. yeah, we usually have Chinese once a month.",
        "What do you look for in a restaurant?",
        "I hate franchised restaurants.",
        "You what? You, -",
        "Oh I, -",
        "Right.",
        "some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost.",
        "I know what you mean. I like some ambiance, and I like good food. I don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that.",
        "I don't, but I don't like something fake or put on either.",
        
        "You know, if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant.",
        
        "And I don't know why that is. I think it's probably due to pricing, often.",
        "Right, uh-huh. I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it.",
        "Well, yeah, yeah,",
        "Yeah.",
        "It is what you look for?",
        "It isn't, no that isn't what I look for.",
        "Oh, isn't, isn't. I try to get my money's worth.",
        "Right.",
        "And not just that, I try to, well, that's a big part of it. I try to get my money's worth.",
        
        "You know, and not just in quantity, you know, but quality, and, and flavor and texture and care.",
        "Presentation and, -",
        "Well, presentation's not always all of it either.",
        "It's, it's important.",
        
        "So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something like that. -",
        "Yeah, that's what I mean by, -",
        "Right, uh-huh. It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.",
        "Yeah, yeah. What I miss up here is, - I'm originally a Texan, and I miss home cooked Mexican.",
        "Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex.",
        "Yeah, home cooked Tex-Mex.",
        
        "Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "It's all pretty good, isn't it?",
        "Oh, yes, and, and there's big differences, of course, and, of course, when you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking about American food or Chinese food, <noise> <<dishes in background>> because its regional, too.",
        "Right, uh-hthat's true.",
        "So. -",
        "I'm originally from Maine, so we like seafood, too. And that's something we don't get here, and we're in the mountains in Virginia.",
        "Oh.",
        "And most of the seafood's frozen.",
        "Right.",
        "Uh-hthat's true. Lots of shrimp.",
        "And, yeah, here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation. And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week.",
        "I know it.",
        "And it was, I was like a man starving at every meal.",
        "I know the feeling. We do the same thing. My son-in-law is a Texan, and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there.",
        "It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it? Lobster?",
        "It's like shrimp on the Gulf.",
        "Two ninety-eight a pound.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh yeah, cheaper, right.",
        "Right, yeah. A lot of the restaurants you can get two pou-, two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety-nine.",
        "Oh, my gosh. I've got to go to Maine then <noise> <<dishes rattling in background>>.",
        
        "You may have sold a trip for some time.",
        "Yeah, it's a good place to go.",
        "it sounds wonderful. so, -",
        "Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there.",
        "That sound good. down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little seafood shacks, we've called them.",
        "Right, uh-huh.",
        "And, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen.",
        
        "We went to Gal-, +",
        "We were in Galveston last year aft-, right aft-, well, the first of this year, actually.",
        "Hm.",
        "And, ate in a restaurant, and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.",
        "Was it true?",
        "No. It wasn't. On the way across Louisiana, we pulled off, we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place. And they had, - it was a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way, and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything.",
        "Hm.",
        "And then one complete seafood buffet.",
        "Huh.",
        "That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life. They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.",
        "yes, the cajuns.",
        "Uh-hright. It was wonderful.",
        "They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can.",
        
        "So, have you eaten crawfish yet?",
        "I tried it, but I didn't care for it. Not there, but at my brothers I tried it.",
        "Oh, as with anything, it's preparation.",
        "Uh.",
        "Uh-huh. It, - there's all kinds,",
        "Probably needed some cold beer with it and, -",
        "So you do eat out a lot.",
        "Quite a bit.",
        "One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.",
        "Oh.",
        "You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches.",
        "Right. We used to do that, once in a while, but we don't anymore.",
        "we still find it fun.",
        "Uh-huh. It's fun, but it's just so much food. Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable.",
        "Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.",
        "Do you, well that makes a difference.",
        "And so, -",
        "Where do you go to brunches? Like at hotels, or restaurants there?",
        "Yeah, actually one of our, one of our favorites is a chain. Shoney's.",
        "Oh, yeah, uh-huh. We eat at Shoney's.",
        "Yeah, <noise> <<dishes rattling>> in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, we, do like Shoney's pretty well, but then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation.",
        "Oh.",
        "And, and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast.",
        "Uh-hthat sounds nice.",
        "It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.",
        "Right, I imagine it is.",
        "I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch. You know, and it's not that far. It's thirty miles.",
        "Whe-, - out of, which direction?",
        "Colorado Springs.",
        "Out of, which direction from there?",
        
        "There you go.",
        
        "Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials and should the jury recommend, sentencing.",
        
        "Now my personal opinion, - I don't know. here lately it seems, - well up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, - oh, they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just about ev-, everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole.",
        
        "It's just not right.",
        "I think I agree with that very much.",
        "Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like that, and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done?",
        
        "I never have either.",
        "Is there a reason why you have never, -",
        "I've just never been called up.",
        "Uh-huh. My husband works as a police man, so I always assumed that that was why I was never called.",
        "Well now, that's possible.",
        
        
        "Uh-huh. do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?",
        "Not that I know of.",
        "Somebody told me the other day that there is, what they call a six man jury, and I had never heard of such thing, and I wondered if it was true.",
        "Uh-huh. I've never heard of it.",
        "I never had either, but I just wondered. another question was, should a criminal case, should the jury be unanimous on their decision, and that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not.",
        "<cough> well, there again, I suppose it should be.",
        "Exactly.",
        
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        
        "Bring some of these things out.",
        "Yes.",
        
        "We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials.",
        
        
        "I have, I still have a little bit of a problem with that. but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time.",
        "Oh, that's it, and you just might resemble somebody.",
        
        "out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice. It was finally, after nine years, it was finally, taken care of.",
        
        "Oh.",
        "And even though he had witnesses that said that, he was at work, and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not,",
        "They still found him guilty?",
        "They found him guilty.",
        "When people said he was at work?",
        "Well, they said it w-, - this, this happened during lunch time.",
        
        
        "Yeah.",
        "But after nine years, - well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove that he was innocent.",
        "Oh, for heaven's sake. So there's nine years of that man's life gone.",
        "Exactly.",
        
        "Now that just was not fair.",
        "No, huh-uh.",
        "So. -",
        "Yeah, I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies, we're, we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial.",
        "Yes.",
        "And, +",
        "Unfortunately, that's what happens.",
        "And we often forget about the one the injustice has been done to, because I bet, they still say our system is the best in the world.",
        "Well, it's not, the, it's not the best system, but it's the best one in the world.",
        "Yeah, it's the best one that exists, I guess.",
        "Uh-huh. And unfortunately, we just have to put up with a lot of things, and they try to solve them and everything, but, I don't know, the Supreme Court, well, I'm, I'm, I'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag.",
        "Oh, I think a lot of people are. I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country.",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "And, well that just rancles me no, I swear, if I ever saw somebody to, burning a flag, I'd, I'd try to kill them, I would.",
        "That bad, huh. I wouldn't like it, but I don't know if I'd go that far.",
        
        
        "Yeah, well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important. It's important in so many facets of our lives.",
        
        "And, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else.",
        "Yeah, see what they, +",
        "There's nobody holding them here.",
        "See how they'd like it under another flag.",
        "Right. They'd soon be back, I'm sure.",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here.",
        
        "I hope they get something out of this.",
        
        "Well, yes, but I think the jury should be able to recommend,",
        "Make a recommendation?",
        "Yes.",
        "Do they sometimes make a recommendation?",
        "Oh, yes, yes.",
        "That's what I was thinking they, they sometimes do.",
        "I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what. But I know I'm always hearing that, well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict and they recommended,",
        "And they recommend.",
        "twenty years or something.",
        "Yes.",
        "Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence.",
        
        "They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five.",
        
        "Yeah, but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole and, -",
        "Uh-huh. A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do. And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again.",
        "Yes. They just go out and repeat their crimes.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "Well there, - well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison, but I think they ought to make it two offenses.",
        "Uh-huh. I always thought there was, there was wrong, - it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody.",
        
        "It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good, - the balance isn't right. It doesn't make sense.",
        "Yeah, very true. Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently.",
        
        "Race or nationality even.",
        "Uh-hyeah.",
        "But, like you said, it's, it's not the best system, but it's the best one we've got.",
        "Yeah, right. So, let's put up with it, I guess.",
        
        "Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.",
        "Sure enough.",
        "So. -",
        "Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you.",
        "Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack, and I hope you have a real good day and week.",
        "Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing.",
        "I hope not.",
        "Take care now.",
        "You, too.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "Are you a T I -er?",
        "yeah, I am.",
        "Oh, good.",
        "I, -",
        "at one o'clock on Friday.",
        "It is Friday, yeah,",
        
        "that's for sure. Well, I guess, - I'm trying to think the last thing I did to a car.",
        "I, I, I do it a lot. I have, - I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid.",
        "Oh, wow. Okay.",
        "so, and my father and brother were in it and, and my brother's still in it. And I had periods when I didn't do anything, but in the last ten years I've, my car doesn't go to a shop, you know, it, it, -",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "Sure.",
        
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I've heard, - when I used to go there and when I, I just overheard what they did for me, very little because I didn't take it that much. But what I heard them tell other people was always right.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, when I sat there, I, you know, I dropped my car off for tires or something like that.",
        "Right.",
        "And so I respect, - they seem to actually have mechanics there.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah. That's, that's the aggravating thing. Yeah, I, I try to do as much as I can. I, I grew up on farm so I've got that, you know, take care of yourself attitude.",
        "You had to do it. Yeah, right.",
        "Oh.",
        
        "oh, timing belts and things like that. Um, I guess the last thing I took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car, um, when we went in for inspection.",
        
        "It didn't, it didn't quite pass.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So we had to have, - that's, that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it.",
        
        "And they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out, to get to it.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "And, -",
        "Well, you like Fords, apparently, huh?",
        "Yeah, yeah. I've, I'm kind of stuck on them right now, I guess. But, you know, that's, - it's partially because I can work on them. That's, uh,",
        "Yeah.",
        "Really?",
        "My goodness.",
        "Li-, little things like that, that really start to aggravate you. That, that's a lot of the reason I do my own stuff.",
        "Yeah. I won-, always wonder when you have little things like that happen, why, even here at T I, why we don't inspect, I'm in facilities, why we don't inspect areas and, and guarantee it so to speak. Uh,",
        
        "Sure.",
        "Sure. Yeah, i-, -",
        "I, I always wonder about that when, when someone does repairs or little things like that, uh,",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, no,",
        "I don't either. I don't either, yeah.",
        "But, i-, it, it's, it's real stressful to try to find anybody that I think's going to do me right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, and, you know, have an idea of what's going on.",
        "You need to really, - I, I do, a lot of the simple things. I, I think I do most of the things better than the average person.",
        
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I like a V-eight. And I'm, I'm, ]",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "s-, sold on small block Chevy V-eights. And I, +",
        "Yeah.",
        "I bought one car new, and I almost accidentally got the next car, although I was kind of looking for it when I got a u-, a used car with the same engine.",
        
        "Well then the nex-, the truck I got next, I definitely looked for the same engine. So I buy filters, you know, three or four at a time.",
        "Sure.",
        "Sure.",
        
        "And the par-, the carburetors is the same. Almost everything is the same. Th-, the course is two are eighties and one eighty-six, you know.",
        
        "So you can learn a lot that way. I, - there's no way I could, I could fix every car in the world, you know.",
        "Well, yeah. That, that, - the biggest, you know, that's the three biggest things to me, you know. I-, i-, - number one, you've got to have the tools around.",
        "Yeah.",
        "If you don't have the, the special tools or, - well, any more the, the testers, that, you know. -",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, and the only reason I did it, - I, -",
        "I think they're all bad, really. They're, -",
        
        "Is that right?",
        "Yeah. But, but, I, I had, I had taken this in to have it done originally.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, -",
        "What did they want to charge you for it?",
        "Oh, it, it was, it was tremend-, - well it was about seven hours labor.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So it, it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And they looked it over and they, they, they thought they could patch it up a little bit, you know, and what not. So they, -",
        "This is your little water, heater in there, for the, uh,",
        "Yeah.",
        "the heat inside?",
        "Yeah. And it was, it was leaking inside the car,",
        "Yeah.",
        "in the condenser unit. So, they, they did a little patch on it, and it l-, it held for about four to six months. And I finally went back in and started looking at it myself. And i-, it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff, but,",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It came from, -",
        "Oh, really?",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, this, this was, - the only thing that sticks, in, inside the engine compartment on this are the two, hose fittings.",
        "Maybe you're right, maybe you're right. I, - it's been a long time since I took one out.",
        "Yeah. It, it's, - I, I've never heard a good story about, -",
        "Course, I broke mine, you know, so I'm always very careful when I change hoses on it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't know whether you did yours. Not to really pull on those. - I, +",
        "Right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Because if you sp-, you know, pull on that, - and I've always done that as a kid, you know, just yanked on it.",
        
        "And they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time.",
        "Sure.",
        "But I broke one on my, on my Buick. And I always remembered it was my own fault, and I thought, well I'm going to t-, going to carefully take those hoses off.",
        "You bet. Well that, that's what ended up being the real problem on this, was the, i-, the, the pipe wasn't busted, but the, it wasn't soldered in good enough.",
        "Oh, really? Yeah.",
        "And it had, it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot, -",
        "It, it spread out, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was real aggravating, but, I, I, couldn't eve-, even - a week's, a week's time is, is worth a whole lot less than, four, than four hundred dollars to me, you know,",
        "Yeah.",
        "than to have somebody else do it.",
        "Sometimes if you're a tinkerer, you luck out. My wife's,",
        
        "Chevy, it was a Caprice, air conditioning stopped. I, I just heard it. I realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in.",
        
        "And I went out there for five minutes, and I just pushed on the wires. And sure enough, just pure dumb luck, that the connection over by, - it's not the evaporator, the big filter on one side.",
        
        "I just pushed that in, and I heard it click.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "That's true.",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "I feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things. And I'm going to do that. I, I told my daughters in college this year, I said, This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car. I said, So you can learn the basics, you know.",
        "Well, yeah. A-, - and, and not only from a, from an economic standpoint, just, just pure safety, you know. If you can, +",
        "Yeah.",
        "if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to, to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait. It, it, +",
        "Right.",
        "it can, it can save a lot of time and trouble.",
        "I have the, - there's one expression I don't like, the country expression, you know, if it ain't, if it ain't broke don't fix it.",
        "About how many calls have you made on this system?",
        "I've originated only a, a few.",
        "Oh, okay, yeah.",
        "But I've received quite a few.",
        "I, I only started doing it after, I started getting calls and said, oh, heck, that's right, I'm supposed to make a few calls. So I started about a month ago and I, -",
        
        "this is getting close to twenty here which is I think is about all, our little gift book goes up to, but I don't really know.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I've got about twelve tickets in the mail. Do you have, - you've a few?",
        "Yeah, I've been getting mine.",
        "Okay, medical - go ahead, I'm, I'm medical. That's mine.",
        "you pushed the record button. We're supposed to be discussing the subject.",
        "Yeah. I, I'm benefits. Go ahead, you first.",
        "Yeah, well, I'll tell you, I've been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies, and, it's hard to beat any of the benefits that, or salaries either,",
        
        "Oh, yeah.",
        
        
        "be better and better.",
        "Well, -",
        "Then sal-, sal-, salary continuance, I've never used that one. I hope I never will, but that's kind of like an insurance thing. I sure like that one.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "That's like automobile insurance. You never want to get in an accident but it, you like to have it there.",
        "Uh-huh. Well, like I say, I worked for several different companies and there's nothing to compare with, T I here.",
        
        "Now I really got caught up back in eighty-five, I got caught up in the oil layoff, I wasn't with G S I, but I was connected with, oil, uh,",
        "Right.",
        "exploration.",
        "With T I, or somebody else?",
        "No, with T I.",
        
        "But I say, I wasn't connected with G S I.",
        "Oh, right, yeah.",
        "And, I got caught up in a layoff.",
        "Um.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "for us. they had out of town newspapers and then, -",
        "And outside consultants. Didn't they have an outside consultant, too?",
        "I beg your pardon.",
        "Did they have an outside consultant, like a, the employ-, -",
        "yes. They did have, seminars every once in a while.",
        "Yeah.",
        "course that was not, restricted just to just us.",
        "Right.",
        "But the most important thing was that, they had made up the difference between, unemployment pay and seventy-five percent of my net pay. And they then, - T I paid me that.",
        "Oh, really?",
        "So, I was able to, not just exist. I mean, I, I lived just as comfortably as I did before I was laid off.",
        "Yeah, they seem to be do-, doing a good job of that. I'm in facilities, and our organization built, builds those facilities over in Park Central now.",
        
        "And I guess they've been using them for six months now. And I've known several engineers that got laid off and they said it's like getting a Ph D almost, they, the much they learn over there, you know, after they've been laid off, one engineer said it was really an education. He, he just learned, like you, he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own. He was very thankful for that, too.",
        "Well, this was not a learning thing by any means. It was just a, uh,",
        "To have an office, yeah.",
        "an assistance trying to find another job.",
        "Yeah. Well, he said he learned so much and how, - he thought, he thought he had a Ph D in how to get a job after he was,",
        "Oh.",
        "through the whole process,",
        
        "for, for several months. He did eventually get a job.",
        "Well, course I went through this, what, about five years ago. They may have improved it considerably.",
        "Yeah, apparently. It's very sophisticated. And I guess it may be one of the best, that anyone's doing.",
        "Well, that's one of those little, little extras that you don't see in the, the, the, the handbook, you know.",
        "Right. You're absolutely right. That's a good one.",
        "It, -",
        "What do you think about pensions? Anything on that or, -",
        "Well, now I have, - I'm getting close to retirement.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, of course I've been looking into it but, since I'm only a yellow badger,",
        
        "I won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from T I,",
        "Right.",
        "as far as retirement is concerned.",
        "What do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a four O one account. I, I've been thinking about that for years, uh,",
        "I've never heard of such a thing.",
        "I know. That's what I'm saying that, that pensions, - you see, just like you were, you're saying, you've only got, so many years, say you work for two, three companies, you take your pension with you after you're vested.",
        
        "And then just add the money together like you do with a four O one account, you know.",
        "yeah.",
        "it's your account, period. It doesn't matter where you go or anything. That's your account to roll over.",
        "I, - that, that sounds like a hell of an idea. I didn't know there was such a thing.",
        "No, no there isn't. I, I'm saying that's the question. What do you think could be better and I'm saying that pensions, say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away, which it probably will, - I think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose. So you work for a company seven years, -",
        "Yes, by all means. Well, what would be the difference between that and social security?",
        "well social security's going to go to way, I think and you can, or you can invest your own money. You have no control over your social security. And it's not paid for by the current, - like when, - say we retire after the year two thousand, social security's paid for by the twenty-five year olds. You know, they may rebel and you won't have any social security. Where, if your money was in your account, I mean, you can never lose it, it's there.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "You don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you, you know. That's just a thought. I mean, I, -",
        
        "if they say which, -",
        "No, I, I like the idea.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Course, that's, that's, some-, something like an I R A.",
        "Yeah, and instead of having a, a socialized pension, it just would be really money that you and your company, - maybe you had to put some money in it, too, I don't really know. But I, +",
        
        "I can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are, - you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own, you know. You work for five, six, seven, and y-, y-, - a lot of people I know, guys, -",
        "Yeah, that, that's what I've done. I, I've bounced around.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I change.",
        "I have, too, but not, not quite that often but, yeah, I've only got, I've got, I guess fourteen now here at T I, and I hope to make twenty-five which - say if something happened to me, - I mean, you know, they lay me off, so, you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one. It would be nice if they could get them together.",
        
        "I do worry about medical, though. Again, knock wood that, I haven't used it. I guess you, - I'm sorry, you really do use it throughout the year, because you get your teeth fixed and all that, I mean, I, - but I'm not, - I'm talking about major items I haven't used it for anything major.",
        
        "I'm glad it's there, though.",
        "Well, knock wood, I haven't used mine for anything major. Just doctor visits and, well, I, I have the, the H O M A. I use H O M A.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I like that, a lot better than AETNA.",
        "I have the regular. I, again, I just, - I haven't, - I can't complain about it because I haven't used it and every time I needed it, it, it, it's, you know,",
        
        "fallen right in line for the, the, minor things I guess I'm the one just supporting most of the others.",
        "Well, doesn't it work, you don't see, anything until you spend the minimum?",
        "Uh,",
        "Don't you have to spend the minimum of two, three hundred?",
        "yeah, yeah, I think it's two seventy-five for a family but the dental is right away,",
        "Yeah.",
        "if you, - exams. -",
        "Well now, I have the same dental you have.",
        "Okay. Yeah, the medical you have to have a deductible.",
        "Uh-huh. Now, see I don't have a deductible.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "I pay a straight five dollars for anything, a doctor visit or drugs.",
        "Well, drugs are okay, now, I'm on that, plan, where I take blood pressure medicine. If you take an allergy medicine, so, anything you need a prescription for, for more than six months, you get it for, used to be six bucks, they just raised it to twelve.",
        "Oh, that one I haven't heard about.",
        "Yeah, that's a typical, that's a typical one that's in there. The forms are right in personnel.",
        
        "Fact, you may be able to take care, take advantage of that. It's through",
        "Yeah, I have high blood pressure problems myself.",
        "Maybe you still can do that. Do you, do you buy your pills one at a time?",
        "Yeah, thirty days at a time.",
        "Well, tur-, turn in your forms. Go right to personnel. I don't know whether you have to about an H M O. I don't think so. You turn, you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription and, they're twelve dollars, again, they just were six, they just raised them to twelve this year. Twelve dollars for a three months supply.",
        "Um.",
        
        
        "Go right to personnel. They got the forms in personnel and maybe, +",
        "Yeah, great.",
        "maybe I'll tell you go something you didn't know about in benefits.",
        "Yeah, I just might do that.",
        "I do it, yeah, you know, it's a very common thing.",
        "Well thanks,",
        "It's through Baxter Labs, tell, -",
        "thanks for the tip, Jim.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I shall look into it.",
        "Yeah. What else. I'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever, here.",
        "Yeah. let's see, we discussed, medical and dental,",
        "What other benefits,",
        "retirement.",
        "Yeah, salary continuation. I think that's a great one, but again a hope I never use that one.",
        
        "That means you're really sick if you have to use that one.",
        "What about vacation?",
        "I'm satisfied with the vacation. I don't know what else, you know, you say, say you get another week and, - I'm, well, I only got fourteen years so I'll get another week when I hit fifteen.",
        "yeah, that's right.",
        "So that's, that's fair, I mean, it's reasonable. Four weeks is a lot, I think. I know some people who have twenty-five years and thirty and they want more but, you know, -",
        
        "Uh.",
        "Well, I'm, I'm here, I've got just eleven years and I don't think I'll ever see a, a silver badge.",
        
        "I won't, I won't be around that long.",
        "Well, the way things go, I think I'm going to have to work till I'm seventy-five whether I quit and, or when I retire get a part-time job,",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay. Well, anyways, I'm not exactly sure I, I wasn't really, paying attention as to what particular, parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about, but it was, basically what's your views on, whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used, that sort of thing?",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "I believe in it, too.",
        
        
        
        "But, it's the cases, you know, - like sometimes you, you know, you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, you know, they really didn't do it. Well, you know, you, you got, you got that point well, h-, you know, what, what if a mistake is made and you put someone, you know, to death that really didn't do it.",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "There's always that chance, I don't know, but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know, -",
        
        "You know what I'm saying? Like, -",
        "Right. If, if the evidence wasn't overwhelming, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "So, I, -",
        "Well, I think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, I don't know, I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,",
        
        "I don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.",
        "Yeah, I don't think we, -",
        "No, huh-uh. No we don't.",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "I know Florida has it.",
        "Uh-huh. Oh, yeah,",
        
        "they're always in Florida. Florida and Louisiana, I think, and, some of the,",
        
        "other southern states.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a un-, unemployment rate.",
        "you know, -",
        "Get that unemployment way up so then people, you know tend towards crime, and then they they start stiffening the penalties.",
        "Yeah. But it's funny that, - I mean, like, you know, like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania. I'm not even sure of that, but for some reason I think that, you know, it was something like that. And, it surprised, - and even Florida, I know they have it, and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people, -",
        "Well, in Florida seems like, two or three times a year. It's constantly on the, -",
        "Yeah, but, you, you think that, - I mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,",
        "Yeah.",
        "you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.",
        "No, that's true. Course they have a requirement that, that every single appeal must be permitted.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, of course, the, the attorneys,",
        "Everyone would appeal.",
        "take them through the whole chain.",
        "That's true, too.",
        "You know, even if the case is open and closed, they go all the way up to the Supreme Court, you know.",
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "They almost always get thrown right back out again, but they have to have every single appeal made open to them. And, you know, it's sort of strange because it almost, it almost seems like the attorneys are doing it for the money or something because, I mean, the guy knows that, whether it's, you know, a, a month or two, or six years, he's still going to get, you know, the chair when it comes around.",
        
        "You know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Some of these guys are really, you know, violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that, you know.",
        "Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "I mean, they, -",
        "And then they get out.",
        "everyone knows they're going get, not going to get out.",
        "Yeah, they get out in three years on probation,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and they do it again, you know.",
        
        "It's like a slap on the fingers for them.",
        
        "I don't, I don't, e-, e-, I don't, - I think that it should be, - I mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then I think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also. But, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?",
        "I think so.",
        "Yeah.",
        "a lot of the, the, the other violent crimes I don't really feel that strongly about. Although, you know, stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole, -",
        
        "I mean, these guys are certainly not going to, be, - they can't, - I mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison. I don't think the parole system is really helping that much.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "Yeah.",
        "Off earlier. But some of these guys just don't care,",
        
        "you know. And so, -",
        "I think some of them would rather be in jail.",
        "Yeah, right, uh-huh.",
        "Yeah. They probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.",
        "Um, that's possible I guess.",
        "I don't know, I was just going to say something, I forgot what it was. Oh, I don't even remember what it was now.",
        "Um, so where do you live in Pennsylvania?",
        "In Clarion. Well, I live in Butler, but I'm at c-, I'm at college. I'm at Clarion University.",
        "Oh, okay. I don't think I really know that.",
        "Yeah.",
        
        "See, yeah, okay, well, see, I'm, I'm in kind, I'm in kind, - okay, we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.",
        
        "Yeah, and that would be pushing it. So, I mean this is definitely a college town. we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any. Uh,",
        "Two hours where?",
        "North of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
        "Oh, okay. Near Polk?",
        "Oh, I've never heard of Polk but, -",
        "Polk Institute. It's, an old, university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded. Uh,",
        "Oh, I never heard of that.",
        "Very old, historical place there.",
        "It might have a new name.",
        "Sharon, Pennsylvania's up there.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We're probably about an hour away from Sharon.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Uh-huh. so, I, most of the kids here, I, you know, - like, you know, just from dorm mates and stuff, they'll say that they don't believe in it, but then after I would say my point of view, then they'll say, well, yeah, you know, da-, you know. -",
        "In that case, maybe, you know.",
        "Yeah. You know, I think people can be persuaded one way or another. I've never seriously ran into someone, I mean like, other than my priest, you know, who definitely says you can't take a, you know, you can't take anyone's life. anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.",
        "Right. That's true. Yeah, well, it, it, you know, - you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have, you know, stolen kids and, you know,",
        
        "Exac-, - yeah.",
        
        "And, you know, we had a case like that here and, on the other hand, you know, people are saying that because the, he knows, because the criminals know that the, penalties can be very severe, they, there's less criminals that are, you know, turning themselves in, or, you know, pleading or whatever, because they know that the judge, you know, if they find them guilty is, you know, has the, the opportunity to sentence them, you know, for, for the death sentence.",
        "Yeah, but you know I look at that and say, well, they should have thought about that beforehand.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know.",
        
        
        "You can plea bargain what you're guilty of, but, you know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But not how they're going to sentence you ,",
        "That's something, you know, - but, wh-, whether they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of murder, you know.",
        "Right, uh-huh.",
        "So I don't think that they deserve anything less.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "It's just, - I don't, I don't know, I just, -",
        "Uh-huh. I was just saying that way, - what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then. And so, we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.",
        "Uh-hand that costs money, yeah.",
        "And perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off.",
        
        "And, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways but,",
        
        "There's always a few of those people that are, you know, lost their head or whatever.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Anyways, but, uh. Yeah, we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared and, and the guy, like I said, he just, said that he took her, but he won't admit that she died or whatever, and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very s-, s-, you know, mandatory life sentences for murder.",
        "So, child care, your views.",
        "well, we only have one child right now and another one on the way and right now I'm, I'm all with her during the day. I, if I was looking for outside care I probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find, if I was close to home, relatives or people with it is same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as, as parents.",
        "And what religious faith?",
        "Latter Day Saints.",
        "they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they?",
        "Uh-hand everything in between, yeah, in most states there's nothing to regulate them,",
        "And,",
        "and so, -",
        "whenever they are they seem to regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good.",
        "Right. By trying to get them to conform to concern standards they, kind of, eliminate a lot of the, -",
        "Better situations.",
        "Yeah. The, the, - what am I trying to think of that, - not the imagination but the creativity in, in the situation - and so, -",
        "Yeah, yeah that's, that's very well phrased.",
        
        "so, have you ever used outside child care?",
        "No, I haven't. We've had like people come in and baby-sit for an hour or two but I've never had, um, -",
        "Real day care.",
        "Right. She's, she's not even a year yet, so,",
        "we haven't been in, you know, a lot of need yet.",
        
        "I like that situation, that's usually real good.",
        
        
        "Have a relative struct-, a structured,",
        "seem to be, -",
        "activities and not just, you know, stick them in a corner and say you're on your own.",
        
        "Yeah. I know that, that I guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that, I don't know if the resources are the proper term, you know, just the, the know, knowledge of who's a available, then you could probably find some really good care.",
        "yeah, but I don't know that it would be state approved.",
        "That's true. You can get somebody maybe willing to baby-sit but actual, you know, that's sometimes different, done on a different scale. I have even considered, you know, baby-sitting myself, I have a teaching degree, and, thought well, you know, I could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to, but I think if you take more than three children in, - well, that was how it was this Virginia, we've recently moved here to Texas, but in Virginia I think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed.",
        "I, now I don't know what the current Texas laws are but I, but I do know that the license doesn't seem to, guarantee quality.",
        "Yeah, a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel, file for it just like a business. You may not have to prove any type of qualification for it I don't, -",
        
        
        "That's, kind of a minimum there that you're getting. Your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children, you know, like the educational activities, the supervised play and so forth.",
        "I like that term.",
        
        "Yeah, it was a good influence for your daughter, uh.",
        "Well, that's good.",
        "Uh-huh. Yeah, a little bit of love and, and attention is what most of them need. You know, even if it's not a real educated program you can have good educational program and, and, -",
        "And not have any care.",
        "Right. And, and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself and so, -",
        "And I'm not sure that really child care per se should instill any education per se. Do you know had a I'm saying?",
        "Well, even educated play, supervised play, can teach without, - and I'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or, or, or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills and, you know, like my, my child that, - she want be an only child for long, but, you know, she was an only child, or maybe your daughter,",
        "Proper interface.",
        "not having, - yeah, yeah, just, -",
        "It's just, just correctness of, of social skills, if you will.",
        "Right, those basic things that, they would, that, you know, you would be a little bit of, I don't know if manners is a good term or not but,",
        
        "you know, dealing with other through proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth, you know, that sort of thing, you'd want your child to learn that, from the experience of someone else, certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this, do that, you know, you'd want them it promote politeness and niceness, you know, the things that you would want any child to learn and,",
        
        "the reason, - that's done through example, you know, not an actual sit down learn situation so, -",
        "yeah, it's a very broad issue.",
        "Uh-hit is.",
        "And, you know, it's a shame but most people doing, child care earn almost no money. They operate at, you know, - the owner of the chi-, of a, you know, a large child care facility - now,",
        
        "we're not talking somebody that does six kids,",
        
        "in their home or three or whatever.",
        "Somebody that doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it. You mean somebody that has an actual establishment.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Their employees earn almost nothing.",
        "Yeah. I know I, I did that for summer so I can, I can vouch for that.",
        "And that's really, really a shame too because, - do you and your husband both work.",
        "No, just he does I'm, I'm here during the day with her.",
        "Well, that's wonderful if, if you can make it that way.",
        "Well, we, we decided to, - we live on a lesser budget so that we have - that, that's more important to us, you know, as, as, there may come a time when I will be working again, you know, but right now that's what we've chosen and we wanted to have several, we got her and we've got another on the way,",
        "Well,",
        "and maybe another,",
        "like I said,",
        "one soon after that, so, -",
        "Right.",
        "We're supposed to talk about the Middle East Crisis,",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "and should we be involved and, what's it going to cost us in the long run.",
        "Okay.",
        "Are you ready?",
        "I guess so.",
        "The Middle East Crisis should we be there?",
        "Oh, dear that's a hard one. That's really hard for me because, you know, I really, I have a son that's sixteen and I think, you know, eventually, you know, he'll be of, of drafting age. And I think gosh, do I want him to go and yet I'm proud to be an American and I know that we have a country that, you know, people would give anything to live in, a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have. And yet, I don't know whether I'd be willing to give his life for, for this country and yet, and yet, I know that I, that, - and I, I, when I was in school it was always the tired, the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism but I'm not sure that that's the reason anymore. I mean, not sure that communism is, is as strong as it once was. And I'm not sure that, that that's the reason why we're, like we were in Vietnam supposedly so.",
        "Well, with the, -",
        "Well, it's because of oil isn't it?",
        "No. I really believe it's because, - I think it has something to do with oil, don't get me wrong.",
        
        "But Saddam is, Saddam is a madman.",
        "Oh, yeah. I agree with that.",
        "Anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people, -",
        "Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, he's, a bad person, very definitely,",
        "And,",
        "yeah.",
        "obviously, that has something to do with it.",
        "Oh, sure.",
        
        "Uh-huh-huh.",
        "Yeah, many years.",
        "You know they've been our friends through thick and thin.",
        
        "They,",
        "Well,",
        "were at the Saudi border.",
        
        "And ready to storm into Saudi. Shouldn't we try and help our friends?",
        "What did we lose,",
        "forty-one Americans,",
        "Yeah,",
        "lives.",
        "and that, that's wonderful but what if, if that wasn't the case. What if we would have lost thousands of young men. Would that, would it have been too much of a price to pay for that? I don't know. See, and I think there are a lot of things that we don't know but,",
        "Oh,",
        "that, -",
        "of course,",
        "the American people, -",
        "our government is full of liars, thieves, and crooks.",
        "Oh, sure. Well, and there's a lot,",
        "And that's,",
        "that we, -",
        "our own fault because we elected them.",
        "Yeah. I think that's true but I think there's a lot that we, the public doesn't need to know. I think there's some things we shouldn't know just for nation-, national security sake. And I, you know, I think if we did know I think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because I don't, I don't think people could handle it. So I think there are things that we should not know, the masses shouldn't know but I also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too.",
        "You know, it's, - I went on jury duty here not long back.",
        
        "And one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if, if you could believe a lawyer or if a,",
        
        "lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up, you know,",
        
        
        
        "He told him, Dad, you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you? His lips are moving.",
        "Oh, my gosh. Oh.",
        "And ninety percent of all politicians,",
        
        "and lawyers, -",
        "Uh-huh. Have a lawyer background, yeah. Have a law background, you're right.",
        "So by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars. The fact that they take our money and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves.",
        "Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true.",
        "So what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi? Are we going to lose more lives there?",
        "See, and I don't know, I don't know I can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it. I mean I thought the war was going to go on and on. I really was surprised when it ended so quickly and, -",
        "Well, we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years, the last three years of Vietnam.",
        "I know. Yeah.",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "Right.",
        "You know it's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong.",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "We were there, the Brits were there.",
        "Right.",
        
        "Uh-huh. Right, they were.",
        "So honestly if there is, was a well perceived war, world wide this was it.",
        "Oh, sure. Sure.",
        "But what I can't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth didn't fight, wouldn't fight.",
        
        "It's okay for us to go extend our youth's lives like so much water in the desert.",
        "Yeah. Yeah.",
        "And it's not their job to fight for their own land.",
        "Yeah, that is very it's very strange. and yet, you know, see that's another thing that, that's difficult for Americans, their culture is so much different than ours, you know, I've heard from many people that we could not even begi-, begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours and, um, they just don't think the same way we do. Their culture is completely different and almost opposite.",
        "And really from all I can indica-, from all indications the Iraqi beliefs, if you will, are more similar to our own.",
        
        
        "that's true.",
        "And the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country. The Kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything. They won't work.",
        "I didn't realize that.",
        "Yeah, it was on the news last night.",
        "Oh, my word.",
        "The, U S Army is doing it all.",
        "yeah. See and that's another question you have to ask, is this our job? Is, are we, should we still be there even, you know? I don't know the answers to those questions. I think they're tough and I think, you know, it's, - I don't know that anybody knows the answers. I think they know what they believe but I'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure.",
        "Well, they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday.",
        
        "And her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper.",
        "You're kidding. That's unreal.",
        "And, do you have a housekeeper?",
        "No. No, and don't plan on having one either, ever.",
        "Well, I wouldn't mind having one.",
        "Oh, I'd love to have one but, you know. -",
        "But, you know, I'd like to make sure that I have a job tomorrow first.",
        "Sure. Sure. That's right. That's right.",
        "It, it astound, you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man, woman, and child money.",
        "no. I wasn't, I didn't, wasn't ] aware of that, no.",
        "For nothing.",
        "For doing nothing, yeah.",
        "For noth-, for, for doing nothing. For sitting on there kiesters.",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
        "Oh, that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it?",
        
        "they do nothing. They hand them money each year and they're part of, -",
        "Okay. Um, I don't have any, I guess, definite views about elderly care. Um, the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see,",
        
        "where elderly people are abused and things like that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's one thing that I would look at if I was putting my grandmother or my mother, in some sort of home. The first thing that I would look at would be their history.",
        "Right.",
        "As far as any court cases that came out of there, um, the history of, you know, their doctors, um, their nurses, and things like that.",
        "Yeah. Yeah. I agree with you. I, um, - a group that I'm a part of goes once a month to a, um, they call it the Heritage House.",
        
        "It's, it's a nursing home for elderly people.",
        
        "And this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape.",
        
        "A lot of them have had, um, limbs amputated, or, um, have serious illnesses.",
        
        "You know, that kind of thing. And, um, I watched, - the interesting thing was I watched this particular one change hands. It started out just being a terrible place for the people,",
        
        "and then a new company bought it,",
        
        "and came in and remodeled the whole place.",
        
        "Hired new nurses and, just really, just redid it, you know.",
        "Just out of curiosity, what, what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place?",
        "Well, to me, it was dirty, for one thing.",
        
        "when you would walk in, the smell was just,",
        
        "awful. The, you know, the floors, you could just,",
        
        "if you're walking on them, feel how filthy they were.",
        
        "Um, there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and, you know, crying,",
        "Oh, my goodness.",
        "Of course, I don't know how many of them were, you know, not in their right mind.",
        
        "or how many were, -",
        "In pain or something.",
        "Yeah. Yeah. I just really don't know, but I feel like they were neglected.",
        
        "And, um, yeah, that was what I was going to say. It sounds like just neglect all over.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, neglect to cleanup.",
        "Right.",
        "I don't really think anyone was being, you know, cruel or, +",
        
        "or trying to mistreat them or anything. I just think they were not doing anymore, you know, than they had to do. And, um, just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment.",
        
        "But this new company came in and they, like I said, they remodeled the place.",
        
        "And it smells nice when you walk in. And it looks nice. And they got like several new color T V's for the people,",
        
        "And redid the dining room, where they made it, you know, a lot more place for them to be.",
        
        "They made a little patio area where they can go outside.",
        "That's great.",
        "Yeah. Just, you know, small things that make it seem a lot more homey.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. And it's like, it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just, -",
        "I would, I would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that. And my biggest fear would, that they would be, is that they would be lonely.",
        "Right.",
        "And I would like to know that there are, you know, just a lot of activities, like you said, you know, just putting a plant in a room,",
        "Right.",

        "Right.",

        "They can go outside and, just to know that they're not, you know, laying in a room,",
        "Right.",
        "looking at gray walls. You know,",
        "Exactly.",
        "that, that's what would just really kill me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'd like to know that, you know, they have friends there,",
        "Right.",
        "and they have little conversations and things.",
        "Right.",
        "I'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and,",
        "Yeah.",
        "maybe some kind of, of activity, little field trips or something.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't know how they would do that. But, -",
        "Well, they, - this place that we visit, it's really neat. They have, everyday, they have schedules of groups that come in.",
        
        "And they will do bingo. Our group does a church service once a month.",
        
        "And then other groups come in and do the services, you know, other Sundays,",
        
        "So that they have at least one service every Sunday.",
        
        "So there are a lot of things. There are places that have a lot of things for them to do. But you really do have to kind of seek it out, you know,",
        
        "and make sure that it's not a place like this one was.",
        "I didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that. That's,",
        "Yeah.",
        "really neat.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, it is. It's real nice. And, um, I know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches, and they are just like civic organizations,",
        "Right.",
        "that do. -",
        
        "And, I have other friends. It's kinds of neat, they take animals over and let the people pet them.",
        "Oh.",
        "Like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up,",
        
        "and make sure it's, it's a friendly animal,",
        
        "you know. And take it in and let, just let the old elderly people pet the dogs.",
        "That's great.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That will be something, you know, they would look forward to if they knew, you know, that the puppy is coming on Wednesday.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, that would be something to look for. That's really neat.",
        "Yeah. Yeah.",
        "That really is.",
        "I thought that was a real unusual thing,",
        
        "for someone to do. So, yeah, there's a lot that can be done.",
        
        "It's just a matter of people not being lazy.",
        "Right.",
        "And, you know, doing the best they can. Again, I don't know what I'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother,",
        "Yeah.",
        "you know.",
        "Putting any of my family in an elderly home, to me would be the very last resort.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, it, um, - and I know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to, to work or trying to take care of your own family,",
        "Right,",
        "it's kind of hard to, to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent,",
        
        "you know, on you. And I know that's hard sometimes and, +",
        "Yeah.",
        "but it would really have to be a last resort,",
        "Yeah.",
        "because that would just, I would feel so guilty.",
        "Yeah. Yeah. I would, too.",
        "I don't know. Unless I knew that they were somewhere, just really, I mean, just really great.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "You know, that they were really enjoying.",
        "Yeah. I know. I know what you mean.",
        "I don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home.",
        "Yeah. Well, I have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because, um, many of them, of course, their minds are not good.",
        
        "And so a lot them have told me exactly the same story, you know,",
        "Yeah. Yeah.",
        "every time I visit them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They'll reminisce about childhood,",
        
        "and tell me something that they did and then the next time I go it's the same thing, you know,",
        
        "that, - just somebody to listen to them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "just seems to make them really feel good.",
        "Nod your head and smile at them.",
        "Right. I'll tell you the people I feel the sorriest for, there's a guy at this particular one I go to,",
        
        "that I think that he's really an intelligent person,",
        
        "but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate.",
        
        "And, um, he's blind and he has seizures, you know,",
        
        "I mean, he's just like in a world of his own, and yet he wants so much,",
        "Right.",
        "to be around people. And if you come over to him, if he can touch your hand, he'll grab it and kiss it.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, and he's always got a smile. I mean, he really tries to, brighten up your life. Oh, it's just amazing.",
        "Oh.",
        "But he can't say anything. He can just kind of make noises.",
        "That's something, that, if I had to work in an elderly home, I don't think I could do it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Like I, I would really like to be a teacher,",
        "Yeah.",
        "But I don't think I could do it. Because I'm very, very emotional.",
        "Me, too.",
        "And the minute, I mean, the minute something happens, -",
        "Yeah.",
        "I cry on, I mean, Hallmark commercials.",
        "I know.",
        "That's just the end of me.",
        "I know.",
        "And so I mean something real life, I just, -",
        
        "I interview a lot of children, I'm an education reporter,",
        
        "and I always go and do an education things.",
        
        "I meet these kids who are, you know, dropping out of school left and right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And all the sudden, they're in this program. They're making straight A's, they're going to graduate early,",
        
        "and I'm just, I just want to hug them,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and go, you are just fantastic.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, I could just imagine, you know, working in a home like that,",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "And those people, they're so sweet and, +",
        
        "and so genuine,",
        
        "You know, and all they want is just for everything to be happy,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and you know,",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so that would probably just tear me apart.",
        "Oh, it does.",
        "I mean, in a good way, but,",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know. -",
        "Yeah, it is, it's really hard and, +",
        
        "But one of the neatest things I think though is we always take our kids. I have a three year old and a six year old,",
        
        "and they, um, have gotten comfortable being around these people,",
        
        "because they've always gone with us,",
        
        "and the people love them.",
        "I'm sure.",
        "And they want the children, you know, to hug them or hold their hand and, so far, my kids will do it. Just real easily,",
        
        "and I think it's because they've gone since they were real little,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and they've never been afraid. But that's something, - to me children,",
        
        "you know, need to, - people need to take groups of children,",
        "Right.",
        "Because the kids just brighten up their lives.",
        "Yeah.",
        "As we walk through the, the lobby they'll all say, bring her here. I want to see her. I would love to hold her.",
        "And children, - I mean, usually a of elderly people like to, they like to, share their experiences with the, +",
        
        "with the younger children. They'll be telling them all kinds of stories.",
        "Yeah.",
        "that they don't even know what they mean.",
        "That's true.",
        "You know, they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I'm sure I'll be like that, too.",
        "Well, me, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. It's quite an experience.",
        "But, that's great. I didn't know there were such groups.",
        "Yeah. Yeah there are. And, and, it really helps those people, I think.",
        
        "But, like you said, I'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there.",
        "Yeah. Yeah.",
        "It would be a last resort.",
        "And I would hate it if anyone put me in one.",
        "Oh, I know. I'm always afraid like, oh, no, what if I lose my mind.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Am I going to end up in a place like that?",
        "Somebody take care of me.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well. -",
        "Okay, well, nice to talk to you.",
        "Yeah. You, too, Tonya . Thanks for calling.",
        "Uh-huh. Bye-bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "Okay.",
        "Great. Um, currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "I'm mainly do a lot of walking. I have a son that's a little bit overweight and, um, the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around. So my wife and I kind of take turns. At one time I had a fairly regular exercise program. But, in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down. All this space that normally would be dedicated towards the,",
        "Yeah.",
        "exercise area, is covered in boxes.",
        "Um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly?",
        "Well, I had, a little routine that I did for warm ups.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "And then I did some very mild, say, light weight lifting. Nothing, - I'm not trying to make big bulging muscles,",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age.",
        "Yeah. Um, right now, um, I try when it's nice out, - it's been raining a lot this spring, but I try to, - I have a bicycle and I like to cycle a lot. And, my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas, I don't know,",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "if it's up north, but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Um, so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that. And, um, T I, where I work has, a fitness center so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill, and, um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on. So I try to, I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis. I used to, get into it and get out of it based on my schedule, so I'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now, but it's a big commitment. We don't have any kids yet so, that's a lot of, part of it.",
        "Yeah. That's a plus. Oh, I have a total of five children. I have three left living at home.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "And they do take up a big part of my, my evening and weekend.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up. Yes, when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        
        "That's why, they, really stress, at T I, they really stress, staying in shape, like stay in fit, overall fitness, you know, no smoking and all that. But it's hard to find, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like I know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes and I don't know if that would work for me because I don't know I wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain. But it's really hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever. I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You have to, what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "And you can use what ever rationale you want, but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live.",
        "Right.",
        "And, you know, if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then I'll around a lot longer,",
        "And those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have taken it.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "it's kind of a tip.",
        "Oh, I've done a lot of study over the years and I found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.",
        "Really.",
        "Yeah. Um, the research that I've done - and I've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "And, it's amazing, that, you know, prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "There were none prior to nineteen-hundred. Well, in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities, - and after that we, +",
        ".",
        "we started having the hearts attacks and, Dr. Price wrote a book CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL, AND CHLORINE. You can usually find it in a health food store.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "I know they had it in health food stores in Plano, I used live in Plano.",
        "Dr. Price?",
        "Dr. Price, yeah. And it's amazing, he makes the, you know, - it's a very small book and the guys very opinionated, um, but he makes a very good case against chlorine. There were no heart attacks before we started using it and he points out that people in, England and, - or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now, -",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.",
        "That's really interesting.",
        "Yeah. He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "And, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the,",
        "Yeah.",
        "clogging of the arteries. And, you know, he's, there's been a lot of reports since then. This whole thing about, - first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol, and now they're saying what's cholesterol, well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "You know, it's amazing what he points out in that book and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price in nineteen eighty-seven. And in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis. And, E P A never published that report.",
        "And what's the name of this book again?",
        "CORONARY, CHOLESTEROL AND CHLORINE.",
        "I'll have to remember that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That will be very interesting. My husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon so, he's really interested in the heart.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And he's, in fact, he's a, well, heart, too, - he's, he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise. Sorry, he made me laugh. Um, so anyway, -",
        "Yeah. There is, there is a lot of good information out there, about health. And a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you,",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "but to believe some of the things, you know, - and I don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet, but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe.",
        "If you get a chance read Dr. Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "That's a real good, um, - he talks about that. Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that.",
        "Yeah. I actually eat pretty much anything that I want.",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "And I've had my cholesterol checked and, a few times and I've never been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty,",
        "Huh-uh.",
        "never. And, I mean, I, -",
        "You have a good ratio of good to bad.",
        "Um,",
        "Cholesterol.",
        "Well, what they tell me, - but, I mean, you know, everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing. You know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But, we've, - I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley, Maryland.",
        "Oh, really.",
        "Yeah and we've had a few of the health fairs up here and, um, you know, I've always come out aces.",
        "That's good.",
        "You know, I'm not really that big on watching what I eat, but I do eat, you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber,",
        "Yeah.",
        "low in fat and all that kind of stuff. But, I mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, I'm not, cholesterol, I'm not worried about it.",
        "Yeah, I think, um, this is a tough subject because, when you come from two different parts of the country, the political views are really different. I, I, I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues,",
        
        "I guess like, like they're nothing, I guess, nothing is as awful as abortion but like gun control and, day care an things like that, - and there are some very different views, of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting, you know.",

        "and was going target shooting, you know, and it was very different it was a whole,",
        
        "different view. It's really, um, this has opened my eyes to thinking, you know, at one time I just sat here and thought, well, how can anybody believe that because I'd really never met people that did, and now, I talk to people that do. So that's, it's really interesting.",

So if you're renting a house or doing anything else, you're not actually contributing to the education of your children. And I think that's wrong, I think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system. So, as it turns out, we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it.",
        "Yeah, I, I spent a couple, years down in, Plano, Texas.",

        "And, I, f-, you know, I know that Texas doesn't have a state tax,",
        "No, huh-uh.",
        "and so all the things come out of the, the property taxes,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and I was, really shocked at the amount of taxes I ended up paying. I was, I was better off paying a state tax mo-, back in Maryland, where,, -",
        "Yeah, yeah you would be.",
        "than I was, paying the, property tax down there. what they did in Maryland to get around that is they, they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services,",
        "that the renters were getting including the, educational services.",

        "long, long time ago, when I used to live in apartments, I would pay a rent payment every month and a tax payment every month.",
        "Gee.",
        "And the tax payment went to pay for the services that I was getting as a, a resident of that particular county.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, that's the way it worked. Here in Maryland we have, a certain portion of your, your property taxes, goes to education,",
        "Yeah.",
        "but also a portion of the state tax that you pay goes back into the county that you live in, to pay for the educational system.",
        "Oh, well that's pretty good.",
        "And so it, it works out nice, it, it, it makes it so that the, whole county now, - I, I know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland, like Collin County, would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County, here in Maryland.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I mean the, the counties are much larger.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, in the, the whole state of Maryland I believe there's only like, fifteen counties.",
        "Gee whiz.",
        "And, so, you know each county has their own school system an, and it works out real nice. Um, the, the flip side to this is, are we getting what we're paying for,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and I don't believe so, um. A lot of things have come to head recently and I heard a report because, of, the emphasis that the President was putting on education, you know,",
        
        "him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Um, they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education, in other words, they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, then, at the end of, school year they would be tested and then they go into the fourth grade and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So when they came up with these, this nationwide system of public schools, they gave some figures out and since it's inception, they've, the price has gone up per stu-, the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty-three percent.",
        "Yow.",
        "And so they're actually spending thirty-three percent, and that's real dollars, you know,",
        "Yeah.",
        "adjusting it back to, to the days, you know, when it started, probably, you know, seventy years ago. And what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty-three percent improvement in education.",
        "No, huh-uh.",
        "We've actually gone backwards.",
        "Well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation. That our high school graduates can't even match the national average.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, you know, our school system down here is no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it.",
        "Yeah, well, they, they've been having some problems, even here in, like Baltimore City which is, a, a, pretty good ci-, goo-, good sized city.",
        "Yeah.",
        "they've been putting a lot of, stress on it and of course, speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to, you know, do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've, been cutting the teachers salaries,",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "because they say we don't have the money to do it and,",
        "Yeah.",
        "all the services are costing more money and, and everything, but the-, a lot of emphas-, now is being put on, you know, when children used to be taught, you know, like, each child is individual,",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, they need to take things at their own speed.",
        "Yeah.",
        "and then all of a sudden everything clicks in, you know. And then there are some students that, you know, read well at five years old,",
        
        "and, you know, seem to excel. And so that, the, you know, one of the things I heard proposed on, one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed. Some ki-, -",
        "Yeah, I think it'd be a lot better.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, and, uh,",
        "or, you know, at the kids.",
        "and on top of that they, they make the child feel inferior,",
        "Uh-hbecause he can't do it.",
        "because he's not as good as another kid his same age. I mean, it's like, you know, that's ridiculous.",
        "And it's not that he can't do it, he just can't do it quite as fast, or, -",
        "Yeah, and, you know, I have, I, I have five children total,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and I've got two out of the house already and I ha-, I have two that are in, eighth grade this year.",
        "All right.",
        "And prior to their, um, - when I, when they were in elementary school they were identi-, identified as being slow.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade.",
        "Um.",
        "And it wasn't until the last two years, um, last year my, - they're they're a set of twins,",
        
        "um, a boy and a girl. Last year the, the, boy twin started doing real well.",
        "All right.",
        "And it, it, everything started to click in for him and he knew what he needed to do. Um, and this year it, it happened for, for the daughter.",
        "Um, all right.",
        "She just has been,",
        "Jumped on out there.",
        "really doing great this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything.",
        "That's good.",

        "Yeah, I did too, up until ninth or tenth grade.",
        "yeah, about the seventh, eighth grade I, I, I started to, to come around and realize an, and basically I got interested in math,",
        "Yeah.",
        "and, never really did well in english but, you know once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off.",
        "Yeah, and see when I was a kid growing up and going to high school if I wanted to take a little electronics course, I had a electronics course I could take, but we lived out in the country,",
        

        "Yeah.",
        "and, you know, we had just about every thing that we needed but they don't have it anymore. There's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore. M-, our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here and they go to school four and half days a week, so.",
        "Gee.",
        "That's pretty weird.",
        "Yeah it is, um, my children had a, real culture shock, when we lived in Plano, I guess, I don't know if you've heard about the Plano school district, but.",
        "No.",
        "they're re-, they really stress academics there.",
        
        "And, God, if your child is not an honor student, well then, you're, something wrong with you as a parent.",
        "Gee.",
        "And tha-, that's kind of the way they are there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, when we moved back to Maryland, um, I moved to a, a, ]",
        
        "and it's basically a rural county, once you get above about the half way point.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And we lived, you know, in the northern part of the county. we went from a, middle school in Texas that served fifty-five square blocks to a, middle school in Maryland that served fifty-five square miles.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it was just a complete culture shock,",
        "I can imagine.",
        "because I mean, they, they're riding on the bus in the morning with, other kids that, you know, are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores and,",
        "Yeah that would be quite a shock.",
        "they you know, - it's, - and they had, ag, they had an ag course, I forget what it was called, but it goes along the, the lines of industrial arts, but it's, agricultural.",
        
        "And where they had to raise a small animal.",
        "Oh, like, Four H then.",
        "Had to learn how to drive a tractor.",
        "All right.",
        "They actually had to g-, take a driving test on the tractor, I mean, they just couldn't believe this and it was great. They loved it.",
        "All right.",
        "I mean they really enjoyed the courses, um, and it, you know, it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain, a drain.",
        "Yeah, just something you do everyday.",
        "Yeah, and it was, you know. It was like, ki-, kind of like the way we feel about going to work.",
        "Yeah, yeah, just something I have to do everyday.",
        "But, up here they seem to have made it, a lot of fun for them and they, they seem to really enjoy it.",
        "That's good, our oldest boy went into school politics and made vice <TV> ... -",
        "Okay. Um, I think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service because it, it seems like - and I'm, I'm thinking of the com-, of community of people that are in jail now, I think that maybe if, if, if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community, gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they, they understand people more, they understand helping people more, they understand the plight of people.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah.",
        "they would understand how other people live and,",

        "That's right.",
        "was a big part of, of family, a big part of, of what, you know, your, your, youngsters thought about, what they did,",
        "Yeah.",
