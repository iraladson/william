        "do you have a pet Randy?",
        "currently we have a poodle.",
        "it's miniature.",
        
        "I read somewhere that the poodles is one of the the most intelligent dogs around.",
        "So you you've only known the dog how long did you say?",
        "how old is the dog?",
        "It just turned two, I believe.",
        "it's still just a pup.",
        "Pretty much, yeah, yeah.",
        "Oh, that sounds interesting.",
        "she weighs in at about fifty pounds, so she's a medium size.",
        "But she's big enough to be intimidating,",
        "she was teaching me.",
        "Oh, I wouldn't doubt it, yeah.",
        "She's the most intelligent dog I've ever seen.",
        "You know, the first time I brought her home, she was only, was it six weeks old. And I spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area.",
        
        "But, next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom.",
        "So, on next night, I spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there.",
        "But it wasn't too long until she, found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning.",
        "I live alone.",
        
        "we've always got, got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door.",
        
        "She's definitely ready to get out and run around.",
        "Well my dog is an outdoor type", 
        "she does not like to be indoors.",
        "she'd rather sleep outside on the cold ground at night.",
        "Oh wow.",
        "I do make her come in.",
        "And I feed her indoors", 
        "that's to lure her in, but during the day I have her on a on a leash,",
        "which is, on sort of a run. I have a, a thirty foot cable,",
        "running from one stake to another, and then attached to that is a twelve foot leash,",
        "so she can cover quite an area.",
        "Most definitely.",
        "And, she's the best, burglar alarm going.",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah that's, definite security involved in, in a dog like that.",
        "Oh, yeah, she, - it's the strangest thing, though, children, no matter how strange they are, or how new they might be can walk, right up to her,",
        
        "she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.",
        "the line is between children and adults.",
        "Yeah, that's interesting.",
        "she is a great comfort to me.",
        "I know our dog has had some different reactions.",
        "if the child is pretty straight forward she's fine.",
        
        "it's a matter of exposure really.",
        "we took her home to my family's place in South Dakota",
        "she was the one that was intimidated then.",
        "There was about seven kids ranging from about three years to ten years running around the house all at one time,",
        "She really didn't know how to handle herself.",
        "You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.",
        "What's her name by the way?",
        "what do you call the dog?",

        "I had a similar experience.",
        "I grew up on a farm so I always had outdoor pets.",
        
        "he was a real lovable type,",
        "Oh, what a shame.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well Randy, we've just about used up our time here,",
        "I must say it was interesting.",
        "Most definitely.",
        "I enjoyed talking about pets with you.",
        "Well that's great.",
        "Maybe we'll get together again in the future.",
        "That sounds real good.",
        "Take care now.",
        "You too.",
        "Bye.",
        "I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.",
        "I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.",
        "I know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive.", 
        "I have a suspicion that the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico.",
        "What is your situation?",
        "I guess I don't have such close experience with an area becoming a state as you do.",
        "My concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low standard of living.",
        "Part of this I suppose is justified in that the climate they don't need.",
        "I guess I would favor status quo.",
        "I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting.",
        "I did Peace Corps training there.",
        "Oh that's very interesting.",
        "you know I saw it", 
        "it was very foreign in a certain sense", 
        "I had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem.",
        "It was very lovely and the people seemed very friendly and nice.",
        "I work with a girl from Puerto Rico", 
        "I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors.",
        "I'm not quite sure how the they cope with this sort of thing.",
        "I've live abroad most of my life",
        "I've been very cut off.",
        "I lived actually in Lebanon", 
        "I was very cut off from the press as I was becoming an adult.",
        "I don't know how the they would cope with a new state that is so very poor.",
        
        "I suppose the whole country would require such aid.",
        
        "Perhaps compulsory education.",
        "taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.",
        "I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.",
        "the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states.", 
        "I had thought of it more in terms of political realization.",
        "Well it sounds as though you are in favor of the status quo.",
        "I believe I would probably tend towards that.",
        "I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance.",
        "I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point.",
        "What about if they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.",
        "I don't think there is any prohibitions.",
        "I would be bothered by that.",
        "I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of my strengths.",
        
        "I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines", 
        "I'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past",
        "a common language is the ultimate bond of a country.",
        
        "I was in bilingual education in California.",
        "I didn't have any problem with my students.",
        "I noticed my brother was learning Spanish in elementary school.",
        "And so, obviously it didn't work in California.",
        "Yeah, but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual.",
        "I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.",
        "I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.",
        "I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness.",
        "I think we have gone to time",
        "I appreciate your having called.",
        "Okay, well thank you very much.",
        "Good bye.",
        "Bye, bye.",

        "I am new to Texas, so I don't even know what the law is,",
        "we do have capital punishment.",
        
        "It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks get into the system.",
        "That happens on occasion",
        
        
        "there are so many chances for appeal.",
        "it's really sad.",
        "someone is calling for someone else to be killed.",
        
        "It is with a lot of other people.",
                
        "I think most states do have capital punishment.",
        "I think America is one of the few countries that still do.",
        "That still does it, that's right.",
        "I was reading something about it the other day.", 
        "I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still.",
        
        "But there's not very many people that actually get killed.",
        "a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.",
        "it seems like a of people live there.",
        "If it finally gets to that point.",
        
        "have to go through the whole thing.",
        "are we doing lethal injection now?",
        "That's that's fairly recent.",
        "it's a little bit more humane",
        "I am sure I would take the lethal injection.",
        "Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "I would have to lean toward capital punishment.",
        "I don't think it's a monetary thing.",
        
        "Some of the crimes are just so brutal.",
        "This may seem to be the best way out.",
        "I don't think it's a monetary thing.",
        "I notice that the crime rate was up.",
        "It's kind of been scary,"
