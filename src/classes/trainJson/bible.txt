Yet you do not know him",
"I know him",
"I were to say that I do not know him",
"I would be a liar like you",
"I do know him",
"I obey his teaching",
"Your father Abraham was overjoyed to see my day",
"he saw it and was glad",
"Then the Judeans replied",
"You are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham?",
"Jesus said to them",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"before Abraham came into existence",
"I am!",
"Then they picked up stones to throw at him",
"Jesus hid himself and went out from the temple area",
"Now as Jesus was passing by",
"he saw a man who had been blind from birth",
"His disciples asked him",
"who committed the sin that caused him to be born blind",
"this man or his parents?",
"Jesus answered",
"Neither this man nor his parents sinned",
"he was born blind so that the acts of God may be revealed through what happens to him",
"We must perform the deeds of the one who sent me as long as it is daytime",
"Night is coming when no one can work",
"As long as I am in the world",
"I am the light of the world",
"Having said this",
"he spat on the ground and made some mud with the saliva",
"He smeared the mud on the blind man’s eyes",
"said to him",
"Go wash in the pool of Siloam which is translated",
"So the blind man went away and washed",
"came back seeing",
"Then the neighbors and the people who had seen him previously as a beggar began saying",
"Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?",
"I don’t know",
"They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees",
"Now the day on which Jesus made the mud and caused him to see was a Sabbath",
"So the Pharisees asked him again how he had gained his sight",
"He replied",
"He put mud on my eyes and I washed",
"now I am able to see",
"Then some of the Pharisees began to say",
"This man is not from God",
"because he does not observe the Sabbath",
"How can a man who is a sinner perform such miraculous signs? Thus there was a division among them",
"So again they asked the man who used to be blind",
"What do you say about him",
"since he caused you to see?",
"He is a prophet",
"the man replied",
"Now the Jewish religious leaders refused to believe that he had really been blind and had gained his sight until at last they summoned the parents of the man who had become able to see",
"They asked the parents",
"Is this your son",
"whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?",
"So his parents replied",
"We know that this is our son and that he was born blind",
"we do not know how he is now able to see",
"nor do we know who caused him to see",
"Ask him",
"he is a mature adult",
"He will speak for himself",
"His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders",
"the Jewish leaders had already agreed that anyone who confessed Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue",
"He is a mature adult",
"ask him",
"Then they summoned the man who used to be blind a second time and said to him",
"Promise before God to tell the truth",
"We know that this man is a sinner",
"He replied",
"I do not know whether he is a sinner",
"I do know one thing that although I was blind",
"now I can see",
"Then they said to him",
"What did he do to you? How did he cause you to see?",
"He answered",
"I told you already and you didn’t listen",
"Why do you want to hear it again? You people don’t want to become his disciples too",
"do you?",
"They heaped insults on him",
"saying",
"You are his disciple! We are disciples of Moses!",
"We know that God has spoken to Moses! We do not know where this man comes from!",
"The man replied",
"This is a remarkable thing",
"that you don’t know where he comes from",
"yet he caused me to see!",
"We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners",
"anyone is devout and does his will",
"God listens to him",
"Never before has anyone heard of someone causing a man born blind to see",
"this man were not from God",
"he could do nothing",
"They replied",
"You were born completely in sinfulness",
"yet you presume to teach us? So they threw him out",
"Jesus heard that they had thrown him out",
"so he found the man and said to him",
"Do you believe in the Son of Man?",
"The man replied",
"who is he",
"that I may believe in him?",
"Jesus told him",
"You have seen him",
"he is the one speaking with you",
"I believe",
"he worshiped him",
"judgment I have come into this world",
"so that those who do not see may gain their sight",
"the ones who see may become blind",
"Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked him",
"We are not blind too",
"are we?",
"Jesus replied",
"you were blind",
"you would not be guilty of sin",
"now because you claim that you can see",
"your guilt remains",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door",
"climbs in some other way",
"is a thief and a robber",
"The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep",
"The doorkeeper opens the door for him",
"the sheep hear his voice",
"He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out",
"When he has brought all his own sheep out",
"he goes ahead of them",
"the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice",
"They will never follow a stranger",
"will run away from him",
"because they do not recognize the stranger’s voice",
"Jesus told them this parable",
"they did not understand what he was saying to them",
"So Jesus said to them again",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"I am the door for the sheep",
"All who came before me were thieves and robbers",
"the sheep did not listen to them",
"I am the door",
"anyone enters through me",
"he will be saved",
"will come in and go out",
"find pasture",
"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy",
"I have come so that they may have life",
"may have it abundantly",
"I am the good shepherd",
"The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep",
"The hired hand",
"who is not a shepherd and does not own sheep",
"sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and runs away",
"So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them",
"Because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep",
"he runs away",
"I am the good shepherd",
"I know my own and my own know me",
"just as the Father knows me and I know the Father and I lay down my life for the sheep",
"I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold",
"I must bring them too",
"they will listen to my voice",
"so that there will be one flock and one shepherd",
"This is why the Father loves me because I lay down my life",
"so that I may take it back again",
"No one takes it away from me",
"I lay it down of my own free will",
"I have the authority to lay it down",
"I have the authority to take it back again",
"This commandment I received from my Father",
"Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people because of these words",
"Many of them were saying",
"He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind! Why do you listen to him?",
"These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon",
"A demon cannot cause the blind to see",
"Then came the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem",
"It was winter",
"Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico",
"The Jewish leaders surrounded him and asked",
"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ",
"tell us plainly",
"Jesus replied",
"I told you and you do not believe",
"The deeds I do in my Father’s name testify about me",
"you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep",
"My sheep listen to my voice",
"I know them",
"they follow me",
"I give them eternal life",
"they will never perish",
"no one will snatch them from my hand",
"who has given them to me",
"is greater than all",
"no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand",
"The Father and I are one",
"The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death",
"Jesus said to them",
"I have shown you many good deeds from the Father",
"which one of them are you going to stone me?",
"The Jewish leaders replied",
"We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy",
"because you",
"are claiming to be God",
"Jesus answered",
"Is it not written in your law",
"you are gods?",
"those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ and the scripture cannot be broken",
"do you say about the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world",
"You are blaspheming",
"I am the Son of God?",
"I do not perform the deeds of my Father",
"do not believe me",
"I do them",
"even if you do not believe me",
"believe the deeds",
"so that you may come to know and understand that I am in the Father and the Father is in me",
"Then they attempted again to seize him",
"he escaped their clutches",
"Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John had been baptizing at an earlier time",
"he stayed there",
"Many came to him and began to say",
"John performed no miraculous sign",
"everything John said about this man was true!",
"many believed in Jesus there",
"Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick",
"He was from Bethany",
"the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived",
"Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair",
"whose brother Lazarus was sick",
"So the sisters sent a message to Jesus",
"the one you love is sick",
"When Jesus heard this",
"This sickness will not lead to death",
"to God’s glory",
"so that the Son of God may be glorified through it",
"So when he heard that Lazarus was sick",
"he remained in the place where he was for two more days",
"Then after this",
"he said to his disciples",
"Let us go to Judea again",
"The disciples replied",
"the Jewish leaders were just now trying to stone you to death! Are you going there again?",
"Jesus replied",
"Are there not twelve hours in a day? If anyone walks around in the daytime",
"he does not stumble",
"because he sees the light of this world",
"anyone walks around at night",
"he stumbles",
"because the light is not in him",
"After he said this",
"he added",
"Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep",
"I am going there to awaken him",
"Then the disciples replied",
"he has fallen asleep",
"he will recover",
"Now Jesus had been talking about his death",
"they thought he had been talking about real sleep",
"Then Jesus told them plainly",
"Lazarus has died",
"I am glad for your sake that I was not there",
"so that you may believe",
"let us go to him",
"So Thomas said to his fellow disciples",
"Let us go too",
"so that we may die with him",
"When Jesus arrived",
"he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days already",
"Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem",
"so many of the Jewish people of the region had come to Martha and Mary to console them over the loss of their brother",
"So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming",
"she went out to meet him",
"Mary was sitting in the house",
"Martha said to Jesus",
"you had been here",
"my brother would not have died",
"even now I know that whatever you ask from God",
"God will grant you",
"Jesus replied",
"Your brother will come back to life again",
"I know that he will come back to life again in the resurrection at the last day",
"Jesus said to her",
"I am the resurrection and the life",
"The one who believes in me will live even if he dies",
"the one who lives and believes in me will never die",
"Do you believe this?",
"She replied",
"I believe that you are the Christ",
"the Son of God who comes into the world",
"when she had said this",
"Martha went and called her sister Mary",
"saying privately",
"The Teacher is here and is asking for you",
"So when Mary heard this",
"she got up quickly and went to him",
"Now Jesus had not yet entered the village",
"was still in the place where Martha had come out to meet him",
"Then the people who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out",
"They followed her",
"because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there",
"Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him",
"she fell at his feet and said to him",
"you had been here",
"my brother would not have died",
"When Jesus saw her weeping",
"the people who had come with her weeping",
"he was intensely moved in spirit and greatly distressed",
"Where have you laid him? They replied",
"come and see",
"Jesus wept",
"Thus the people who had come to mourn",
"Look how much he loved him!",
"This is the man who caused the blind man to see! Couldn’t he have done something to keep Lazarus from dying?",
"intensely moved again",
"came to the tomb",
"Now it was a cave",
"a stone was placed across it",
"Take away the stone",
"the sister of the deceased",
"by this time the body will have a bad smell",
"because he has been buried four days",
"Jesus responded",
"Didn’t I tell you that if you believe",
"you would see the glory of God?",
"So they took away the stone",
"Jesus looked upward",
"I thank you that you have listened to me",
"I knew that you always listen to me",
"I said this for the sake of the crowd standing around here",
"that they may believe that you sent me",
"When he had said this",
"he shouted in a loud voice",
"come out!",
"The one who had died came out",
"his feet and hands tied up with strips of cloth",
"a cloth wrapped around his face",
"Jesus said to them",
"Unwrap him and let him go",
"Then many of the people",
"who had come with Mary and had seen the things Jesus did",
"believed in him",
"some of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done",
"So the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together",
"What are we doing? For this man is performing many miraculous signs",
"we allow him to go on in this way",
"everyone will believe in him",
"the Romans will come and take away our sanctuary and our nation",
"Then one of them",
"who was high priest that year",
"You know nothing at all!",
"You do not realize that it is more to your advantage to have one man die for the people than for the whole nation to perish",
"Now he did not say this on his own",
"because he was high priest that year",
"he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish nation",
"not for the Jewish nation only",
"to gather together into one the children of God who are scattered",
"So from that day they planned together to kill him",
"Thus Jesus no longer went around publicly among the Judeans",
"went away from there to the region near the wilderness",
"to a town called Ephraim",
"stayed there with his disciples",
"Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near",
"many people went up to Jerusalem from the rural areas before the Passover to cleanse themselves ritually",
"Thus they were looking for Jesus",
"saying to one another as they stood in the temple courts",
"What do you think? That he won’t come to the feast?",
"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it",
"so that they could arrest him",
"six days before the Passover",
"Jesus came to Bethany",
"where Lazarus lived",
"whom he had raised from the dead",
"So they prepared a dinner for Jesus there",
"Martha was serving",
"Lazarus was among those present at the table with him",
"Then Mary took three quarters of a pound of expensive aromatic oil from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus",
"She then wiped his feet dry with her hair",
"Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil",
"Judas Iscariot",
"one of his disciples the one who was going to betray him",
"Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor?",
"Now Judas said this not because he was concerned about the poor",
"because he was a thief",
"As keeper of the money box",
"he used to steal what was put into it",
"Leave her alone",
"She has kept it for the day of my burial",
"you will always have the poor with you",
"you will not always have me!",
"Now a large crowd of Judeans learned that Jesus was there",
"so they came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead",
"So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too",
"on account of him many of the Jewish people from Jerusalem were going away and believing in Jesus",
"The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem",
"So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him",
"They began to shout",
"Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!",
"Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it",
"just as it is written",
"Do not be afraid",
"your king is coming",
"seated on a donkey’s colt!",
"His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened",
"when Jesus was glorified",
"then they remembered that these things were written about him and that these things had happened to him",
"So the crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify about it",
"Because they had heard that Jesus had performed this miraculous sign",
"the crowd went out to meet him",
"Thus the Pharisees said to one another",
"You see that you can do nothing",
"the world has run off after him!",
"Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up to worship at the feast",
"So these approached Philip",
"who was from Bethsaida in Galilee",
"we would like to see Jesus",
"Philip went and told Andrew",
"they both went and told Jesus",
"Jesus replied",
"The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies",
"it remains by itself alone",
"it dies",
"it produces much grain",
"The one who loves his life destroys it",
"the one who hates his life in this world guards it for eternal life",
"anyone wants to serve me",
"he must follow me",
"where I am",
"my servant will be too",
"anyone serves me",
"the Father will honor him",
"Now my soul is greatly distressed",
"what should I say? ‘Father",
"deliver me from this hour? No",
"this very reason I have come to this hour",
"glorify your name",
"Then a voice came from heaven",
"I have glorified it",
"I will glorify it again",
"The crowd that stood there and heard the voice said that it had thundered",
"Others said that an angel had spoken to him",
"This voice has not come for my benefit but for yours",
"Now is the judgment of this world",
"now the ruler of this world will be driven out",
"when I am lifted up from the earth",
"will draw all people to myself",
"Now he said this to indicate clearly what kind of death he was going to die",
"Then the crowd responded",
"We have heard from the law that the Christ will remain forever",
"How can you say",
"The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?",
"Jesus replied",
"The light is with you for a little while longer",
"Walk while you have the light",
"so that the darkness may not overtake you",
"The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going",
"While you have the light",
"believe in the light",
"so that you may become sons of light",
"When Jesus had said these things",
"he went away and hid himself from them",
"Although Jesus had performed so many miraculous signs before them",
"they still refused to believe in him",
"so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled",
"who has believed our message",
"to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?",
"this reason they could not believe",
"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart",
"so that they would not see with their eyes and understand with their heart",
"turn to me",
"I would heal them",
"Isaiah said these things because he saw Christ’s glory",
"spoke about him",
"even among the rulers many believed in him",
"because of the Pharisees they would not confess Jesus to be the Christ",
"so that they would not be put out of the synagogue",
"they loved praise from men more than praise from God",
"Jesus shouted out",
"The one who believes in me does not believe in me",
"in the one who sent me",
"the one who sees me sees the one who sent me",
"I have come as a light into the world",
"so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness",
"anyone hears my words and does not obey them",
"I do not judge him",
"I have not come to judge the world",
"to save the world",
"The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge",
"the word I have spoken will judge him at the last day",
"I have not spoken from my own authority",
"the Father himself who sent me has commanded me what I should say and what I should speak",
"I know that his commandment is eternal life",
"Thus the things I say",
"I say just as the Father has told me",
"Just before the Passover feast",
"Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father",
"Having loved his own who were in the world",
"he now loved them to the very end",
"The evening meal was in progress",
"the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot",
"that he should betray Jesus",
"Because Jesus knew that the Father had handed all things over to him",
"that he had come from God and was going back to God",
"he got up from the meal",
"removed his outer clothes",
"took a towel and tied it around himself",
"He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself",
"Then he came to Simon Peter",
"Peter said to him",
"are you going to wash my feet?",
"Jesus replied",
"You do not understand what I am doing now",
"you will understand after these things",
"Peter said to him",
"You will never wash my feet! Jesus replied",
"I do not wash you",
"you have no share with me",
"Simon Peter said to him",
"wash not only my feet",
"also my hands and my head!",
"Jesus replied",
"The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet",
"is completely clean",
"you disciples are clean",
"not every one of you",
"Jesus knew the one who was going to betray him",
"Not every one of you is clean",
"So when Jesus had washed their feet and put his outer clothing back on",
"he took his place at the table again and said to them",
"Do you understand what I have done for you?",
"You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord",
"that is what I am",
"your Lord and Teacher",
"have washed your feet",
"you too ought to wash one another’s feet",
"I have given you an example you should do just as I have done for you",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"the slave is not greater than his master",
"nor is the one who is sent as a messenger greater than the one who sent him",
"you understand these things",
"you will be blessed if you do them",
"What I am saying does not refer to all of you",
"I know the ones I have chosen",
"this is to fulfill the scripture",
"The one who eats my bread has turned against me",
"I am telling you this now",
"before it happens",
"so that when it happens you may believe that I am he",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"whoever accepts the one I send accepts me",
"whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me",
"When he had said these things",
"Jesus was greatly distressed in spirit",
"testified",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"one of you will betray me",
"The disciples began to look at one another",
"worried and perplexed to know which of them he was talking about",
"One of his disciples",
"the one Jesus loved",
"was at the table to the right of Jesus in a place of honor",
"So Simon Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to",
"Then the disciple whom Jesus loved leaned back against Jesus’ chest and asked him",
"who is it?",
"It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish",
"Then he dipped the piece of bread in the dish and gave it to Judas Iscariot",
"Simon’s son",
"after Judas took the piece of bread",
"Satan entered into him",
"Jesus said to him",
"What you are about to do",
"do quickly",
"Now none of those present at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas",
"Some thought that",
"because Judas had the money box",
"Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast",
"or to give something to the poor",
"Judas took the piece of bread and went out immediately",
"When Judas had gone out",
"Now the Son of Man is glorified",
"God is glorified in him",
"God is glorified in him",
"God will also glorify him in himself",
"he will glorify him right away",
"I am still with you for a little while",
"You will look for me",
"just as I said to the Jewish religious leaders",
"Where I am going you cannot come",
"I tell you the same",
"I give you a new commandment to love one another",
"Just as I have loved you",
"you also are to love one another",
"Everyone will know by this that you are my disciples if you have love for one another",
"Simon Peter said to him",
"where are you going? Jesus replied",
"Where I am going",
"you cannot follow me now",
"you will follow later",
"Peter said to him",
"why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!",
"Jesus answered",
"Will you lay down your life for me? I tell you the solemn truth",
"the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times!",
"Do not let your hearts be distressed",
"You believe in God",
"believe also in me",
"There are many dwelling places in my Father’s house",
"I would have told you",
"because I am going away to make ready a place for you",
"I go and make ready a place for you",
"I will come again and take you to be with me",
"so that where I am you may be too",
"you know the way where I am going",
"we don’t know where you are going",
"How can we know the way?",
"Jesus replied",
"I am the way",
"the truth",
"the life",
"No one comes to the Father except through me",
"you have known me",
"you will know my Father too",
"from now on you do know him and have seen him",
"show us the Father",
"we will be content",
"Jesus replied",
"Have I been with you for so long",
"you have not known me",
"Philip? The person who has seen me has seen the Father! How can you say",
"Show us the Father?",
"Do you not believe that I am in the Father",
"the Father is in me? The words that I say to you",
"I do not speak on my own initiative",
"the Father residing in me performs his miraculous deeds",
"Believe me that I am in the Father",
"the Father is in me",
"you do not believe me",
"believe because of the miraculous deeds themselves",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing",
"will perform greater deeds than these",
"because I am going to the Father",
"I will do whatever you ask in my name",
"so that the Father may be glorified in the Son",
"you ask me anything in my name",
"I will do it",
"you love me",
"you will obey my commandments",
"Then I will ask the Father",
"he will give you another Advocate to be with you forever",
"the Spirit of truth",
"whom the world cannot accept",
"because it does not see him or know him",
"you know him",
"because he resides with you and will be in you",
"I will not abandon you as orphans",
"I will come to you",
"In a little while the world will not see me any longer",
"you will see me",
"because I live",
"you will live too",
"You will know at that time that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you",
"The person who has my commandments and obeys them is the one who loves me",
"The one who loves me will be loved by my Father",
"I will love him and will reveal myself to him",
"what has happened that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?",
"Jesus replied",
"anyone loves me",
"he will obey my word",
"my Father will love him",
"we will come to him and take up residence with him",
"The person who does not love me does not obey my words",
"the word you hear is not mine",
"the Father’s who sent me",
"I have spoken these things while staying with you",
"the Advocate",
"the Holy Spirit",
"whom the Father will send in my name",
"will teach you everything",
"will cause you to remember everything I said to you",
"Peace I leave with you",
"my peace I give to you",
"I do not give it to you as the world does",
"Do not let your hearts be distressed or lacking in courage",
"You heard me say to you",
"I am going away and I am coming back to you",
"you loved me",
"you would be glad that I am going to the Father",
"because the Father is greater than I am",
"I have told you now before it happens",
"so that when it happens you may believe",
"I will not speak with you much longer",
"the ruler of this world is coming",
"He has no power over me",
"I am doing just what the Father commanded me",
"so that the world may know that I love the Father",
"Get up",
"let us go from here",
"I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener",
"He takes away every branch that does not bear fruit in me",
"He prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit",
"You are clean already because of the word that I have spoken to you",
"Remain in me",
"I will remain in you",
"Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself",
"unless it remains in the vine",
"so neither can you unless you remain in me",
"I am the vine",
"you are the branches",
"The one who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit",
"because apart from me you can accomplish nothing",
"anyone does not remain in me",
"he is thrown out like a branch",
"dries up",
"such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire",
"are burned up",
"you remain in me and my words remain in you",
"ask whatever you want",
"it will be done for you",
"My Father is honored by this",
"that you bear much fruit and show that you are my disciples",
"Just as the Father has loved me",
"I have also loved you",
"remain in my love",
"you obey my commandments",
"you will remain in my love",
"just as I have obeyed my Father’s commandments and remain in his love",
"I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you",
"your joy may be complete",
"My commandment is this to love one another just as I have loved you",
"No one has greater love than this that one lays down his life for his friends",
"You are my friends if you do what I command you",
"I no longer call you slaves",
"because the slave does not understand what his master is doing",
"I have called you friends",
"because I have revealed to you everything I heard from my Father",
"You did not choose me",
"I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit",
"fruit that remains",
"so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you",
"This I command you to love one another",
"the world hates you",
"be aware that it hated me first",
"you belonged to the world",
"the world would love you as its own",
"because you do not belong to the world",
"I chose you out of the world",
"this reason the world hates you",
"Remember what I told you",
"A slave is not greater than his master",
"they persecuted me",
"they will also persecute you",
"they obeyed my word",
"they will obey yours too",
"they will do all these things to you on account of my name",
"because they do not know the one who sent me",
"I had not come and spoken to them",
"they would not be guilty of sin",
"they no longer have any excuse for their sin",
"The one who hates me hates my Father too",
"I had not performed among them the miraculous deeds that no one else did",
"they would not be guilty of sin",
"now they have seen the deeds and have hated both me and my Father",
"Now this happened to fulfill the word that is written in their law",
"They hated me without reason",
"When the Advocate comes",
"whom I will send you from the Father the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father he will testify about me",
"you also will testify",
"because you have been with me from the beginning",
"I have told you all these things so that you will not fall away",
"They will put you out of the synagogue",
"yet a time is coming when the one who kills you will think he is offering service to God",
"They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me",
"I have told you these things so that when their time comes",
"you will remember that I told you about them",
"I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you",
"now I am going to the one who sent me",
"not one of you is asking me",
"Where are you going?",
"Instead your hearts are filled with sadness because I have said these things to you",
"I tell you the truth",
"it is to your advantage that I am going away",
"if I do not go away",
"the Advocate will not come to you",
"I go",
"I will send him to you",
"when he comes",
"he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment",
"concerning sin",
"because they do not believe in me",
"concerning righteousness",
"because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer",
"concerning judgment",
"because the ruler of this world has been condemned",
"I have many more things to say to you",
"you cannot bear them now",
"the Spirit of truth",
"he will guide you into all truth",
"he will not speak on his own authority",
"will speak whatever he hears",
"will tell you what is to come",
"He will glorify me",
"because he will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you",
"Everything that the Father has is mine",
"that is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you",
"In a little while you will see me no longer",
"again after a little while",
"you will see me",
"Then some of his disciples said to one another",
"What is the meaning of what he is saying",
"In a little while you will not see me",
"again after a little while",
"you will see me",
"because I am going to the Father?",
"So they kept on repeating",
"What is the meaning of what he says",
"In a little while? We do not understand what he is talking about",
"Jesus could see that they wanted to ask him about these things",
"so he said to them",
"Are you asking each other about this",
"In a little while you will not see me",
"a little while",
"you will see me?",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"you will weep and wail",
"the world will rejoice",
"you will be sad",
"your sadness will turn into joy",
"When a woman gives birth",
"she has distress because her time has come",
"when her child is born",
"she no longer remembers the suffering because of her joy that a human being has been born into the world",
"So also you have sorrow now",
"I will see you again",
"your hearts will rejoice",
"no one will take your joy away from you",
"At that time you will ask me nothing",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you",
"Until now you have not asked for anything in my name",
"Ask and you will receive it",
"so that your joy may be complete",
"I have told you these things in obscure figures of speech",
"a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in obscure figures",
"will tell you plainly about the Father",
"At that time you will ask in my name",
"I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf",
"the Father himself loves you",
"because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God",
"I came from the Father and entered into the world",
"I am leaving the world and going back to the Father",
"now you are speaking plainly and not in obscure figures of speech!",
"Now we know that you know everything and do not need anyone to ask you anything",
"Because of this we believe that you have come from God",
"Jesus replied",
"Do you now believe?",
"you will be scattered",
"each one to his own home",
"I will be left alone",
"Yet I am not alone",
"because my Father is with me",
"I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace",
"In the world you have trouble and suffering",
"take courage I have conquered the world",
"When Jesus had finished saying these things",
"he looked upward to heaven",
"the time has come",
"Glorify your Son",
"so that your Son may glorify you",
"just as you have given him authority over all humanity",
"so that he may give eternal life to everyone you have given him",
"Now this is eternal life that they know you",
"the only true God",
"Jesus Christ",
"whom you sent",
"I glorified you on earth by completing the work you gave me to do",
"glorify me at your side with the glory I had with you before the world was created",
"I have revealed your name to the men you gave me out of the world",
"They belonged to you",
"you gave them to me",
"they have obeyed your word",
"Now they understand that everything you have given me comes from you",
"because I have given them the words you have given me",
"They accepted them and really understand that I came from you",
"they believed that you sent me",
"I am praying on behalf of them",
"I am not praying on behalf of the world",
"on behalf of those you have given me",
"because they belong to you",
"Everything I have belongs to you",
"everything you have belongs to me",
"I have been glorified by them",
"I am no longer in the world",
"they are in the world",
"I am coming to you",
"keep them safe in your name that you have given me",
"so that they may be one just as we are one",
"When I was with them I kept them safe and watched over them in your name that you have given me",
"Not one of them was lost except the one destined for destruction",
"so that the scripture could be fulfilled",
"now I am coming to you",
"I am saying these things in the world",
"so they may experience my joy completed in themselves",
"I have given them your word",
"the world has hated them",
"because they do not belong to the world",
"just as I do not belong to the world",
"I am not asking you to take them out of the world",
"that you keep them safe from the evil one",
"They do not belong to the world just as I do not belong to the world",
"Set them apart in the truth",
"your word is truth",
"Just as you sent me into the world",
"so I sent them into the world",
"I set myself apart on their behalf",
"so that they too may be truly set apart",
"I am not praying only on their behalf",
"also on behalf of those who believe in me through their testimony",
"that they will all be one",
"just as you",
"are in me and I am in you",
"I pray that they will be in us",
"so that the world will believe that you sent me",
"The glory you gave to me I have given to them",
"that they may be one just as we are one",
"I in them and you in me that they may be completely one",
"so that the world will know that you sent me",
"you have loved them just as you have loved me",
"I want those you have given me to be with me where I am",
"so that they can see my glory that you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world",
"Righteous Father",
"even if the world does not know you",
"I know you",
"these men know that you sent me",
"I made known your name to them",
"I will continue to make it known",
"so that the love you have loved me with may be in them",
"I may be in them",
"When he had said these things",
"Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley",
"There was an orchard there",
"he and his disciples went into it",
"the one who betrayed him",
"knew the place too",
"because Jesus had met there many times with his disciples",
"So Judas obtained a squad of soldiers and some officers of the chief priests and Pharisees",
"They came to the orchard with lanterns and torches and weapons",
"Then Jesus",
"because he knew everything that was going to happen to him",
"came and asked them",
"Who are you looking for?",
"They replied",
"Jesus the Nazarene",
"He told them",
"the one who betrayed him",
"was standing there with them",
"So when Jesus said to them",
"I am he",
"they retreated and fell to the ground",
"Then Jesus asked them again",
"Who are you looking for?",
"Jesus the Nazarene",
"Jesus replied",
"I told you that I am he",
"you are looking for me",
"let these men go",
"He said this to fulfill the word he had spoken",
"I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me",
"Then Simon Peter",
"who had a sword",
"pulled it out and struck the high priest’s slave",
"cutting off his right ear",
"Now the slave’s name was Malchus",
"Jesus said to Peter",
"Put your sword back into its sheath! Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?",
"Then the squad of soldiers with their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up",
"They brought him first to Annas",
"he was the father in law of Caiaphas",
"who was high priest that year",
"Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was to their advantage that one man die for the people",
"Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas",
"Now the other disciple was acquainted with the high priest",
"he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard",
"Simon Peter was left standing outside by the door",
"So the other disciple who was acquainted with the high priest came out and spoke to the slave girl who watched the door",
"brought Peter inside",
"The girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter",
"You’re not one of this man’s disciples too",
"are you? He replied",
"I am not",
"Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire they had made",
"warming themselves because it was cold",
"Peter also was standing with them",
"warming himself",
"While this was happening",
"the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching",
"Jesus replied",
"I have spoken publicly to the world",
"I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple courts",
"where all the Jewish people assemble together",
"I have said nothing in secret",
"Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said",
"They know what I said",
"When Jesus had said this",
"one of the high priest’s officers who stood nearby struck him on the face",
"Is that the way you answer the high priest?",
"Jesus replied",
"I have said something wrong",
"confirm what is wrong",
"I spoke correctly",
"why strike me?",
"Then Annas sent him",
"still tied up",
"to Caiaphas the high priest",
"Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing in the courtyard warming himself",
"They said to him",
"You aren’t one of his disciples too",
"are you? Peter denied it",
"I am not!",
"One of the high priest’s slaves",
"a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off",
"Did I not see you in the orchard with him?",
"Then Peter denied it again",
"immediately a rooster crowed",
"Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s residence",
"Now it was very early morning",
"They did not go into the governor’s residence so they would not be ceremonially defiled",
"could eat the Passover meal",
"So Pilate came outside to them",
"What accusation do you bring against this man?",
"They replied",
"this man were not a criminal",
"we would not have handed him over to you",
"Pilate told them",
"Take him yourselves and pass judgment on him according to your own law! The Jewish leaders replied",
"We cannot legally put anyone to death",
"This happened to fulfill the word Jesus had spoken when he indicated what kind of death he was going to die",
"So Pilate went back into the governor’s residence",
"asked him",
"Are you the king of the Jews?",
"Jesus replied",
"Are you saying this on your own initiative",
"or have others told you about me?",
"Pilate answered",
"I am not a Jew",
"am I? Your own people and your chief priests handed you over to me",
"What have you done?",
"Jesus replied",
"My kingdom is not from this world",
"my kingdom were from this world",
"my servants would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish authorities",
"as it is",
"my kingdom is not from here",
"So you are a king! Jesus replied",
"You say that I am a king",
"this reason I was born",
"this reason I came into the world to testify to the truth",
"Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice",
"Pilate asked",
"What is truth? When he had said this he went back outside to the Jewish leaders and announced",
"I find no basis for an accusation against him",
"it is your custom that I release one prisoner for you at the Passover",
"So do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?",
"Then they shouted back",
"Not this man",
"Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a revolutionary",
"Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged severely",
"The soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head",
"they clothed him in a purple robe",
"They came up to him again and again",
"king of the Jews! And they struck him repeatedly in the face",
"Again Pilate went out and said to the Jewish leaders",
"I am bringing him out to you",
"so that you may know that I find no reason for an accusation against him",
"So Jesus came outside",
"wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe",
"Pilate said to them",
"here is the man!",
"When the chief priests and their officers saw him",
"they shouted out",
"Crucify him! Crucify him!",
"You take him and crucify him! Certainly I find no reason for an accusation against him!",
"The Jewish leaders replied",
"We have a law",
"according to our law he ought to die",
"because he claimed to be the Son of God!",
"When Pilate heard",
"he was more afraid than ever",
"he went back into the governor’s residence and said to Jesus",
"Where do you come from? But Jesus gave him no answer",
"Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know I have the authority to release you",
"to crucify you?",
"Jesus replied",
"You would have no authority over me at all",
"unless it was given to you from above",
"Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of greater sin",
"From this point on",
"Pilate tried to release him",
"the Jewish leaders shouted out",
"you release this man",
"you are no friend of Caesar! Everyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar!",
"When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in the place called",
"Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover",
"Pilate said to the Jewish leaders",
"here is your king!",
"Then they shouted out",
"Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him! Pilate asked",
"Shall I crucify your king? The high priests replied",
"We have no king except Caesar!",
"Then Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified",
"So they took Jesus",
"carrying his own cross he went out to the place called",
"The Place of the Skull called in Aramaic Golgotha",
"There they crucified him along with two others",
"one on each side",
"with Jesus in the middle",
"Pilate also had a notice written and fastened to the cross",
"Jesus the Nazarene",
"the king of the Jews",
"Thus many of the Jewish residents of Jerusalem read this notice",
"because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city",
"the notice was written in Aramaic",
"Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate",
"Do not write",
"The king of the Jews",
"I am king of the Jews",
"Pilate answered",
"What I have written",
"I have written",
"Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus",
"they took his clothes and made four shares",
"one for each soldier",
"the tunic remained",
"Now the tunic was seamless",
"woven from top to bottom as a single piece",
"So the soldiers said to one another",
"Let’s not tear it",
"throw dice to see who will get it",
"This took place to fulfill the scripture that says",
"They divided my garments among them",
"my clothing they threw dice",
"So the soldiers did these things",
"Now standing beside Jesus’ cross were his mother",
"his mother’s sister",
"Mary the wife of Clopas",
"Mary Magdalene",
"So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there",
"he said to his mother",
"here is your son!",
"He then said to his disciple",
"here is your mother! From that very time the disciple took her into his own home",
"After this Jesus",
"realizing that by this time everything was completed",
"A jar full of sour wine was there",
"so they put a sponge soaked in sour wine on a branch of hyssop and lifted it to his mouth",
"When he had received the sour wine",
"It is completed! Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit",
"because it was the day of preparation",
"so that the bodies should not stay on the crosses on the Sabbath",
"the Jewish leaders asked Pilate to have the victims’ legs broken and the bodies taken down",
"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who had been crucified with Jesus",
"first the one and then the other",
"when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead",
"they did not break his legs",
"one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear",
"blood and water flowed out immediately",
"the person who saw it has testified",
"so that you also may believe",
"these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled",
"Not a bone of his will be broken",
"again another scripture says",
"They will look on the one whom they have pierced",
"Joseph of Arimathea",
"a disciple of Jesus",
"asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus",
"Pilate gave him permission",
"so he went and took the body away",
"the man who had previously come to Jesus at night",
"accompanied Joseph",
"carrying a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about seventy five pounds",
"Then they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it",
"with the aromatic spices",
"in strips of linen cloth according to Jewish burial customs",
"Now at the place where Jesus was crucified there was a garden",
"in the garden was a new tomb where no one had yet been buried",
"because it was the Jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby",
"they placed Jesus’ body there",
"Now very early on the first day of the week",
"while it was still dark",
"Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved away from the entrance",
"So she went running to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told them",
"They have taken the Lord from the tomb",
"we don’t know where they have put him!",
"Then Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb",
"The two were running together",
"the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first",
"He bent down and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there",
"he did not go in",
"Then Simon Peter",
"who had been following him",
"arrived and went right into the tomb",
"He saw the strips of linen cloth lying there",
"the face cloth",
"which had been around Jesus’ head",
"not lying with the strips of linen cloth but rolled up in a place by itself",
"Then the other disciple",
"who had reached the tomb first",
"came in",
"he saw and believed",
"they did not yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead",
"So the disciples went back to their homes",
"Mary stood outside the tomb weeping",
"As she wept",
"she bent down and looked into the tomb",
"she saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’ body had been lying",
"one at the head and one at the feet",
"They said to her",
"why are you weeping? Mary replied",
"They have taken my Lord away",
"I do not know where they have put him!",
"When she had said this",
"she turned around and saw Jesus standing there",
"she did not know that it was Jesus",
"Jesus said to her",
"why are you weeping? Who are you looking for? Because she thought he was the gardener",
"she said to him",
"you have carried him away",
"tell me where you have put him",
"I will take him",
"Jesus said to her",
"She turned and said to him in Aramaic",
"Jesus replied",
"Do not touch me",
"I have not yet ascended to my Father",
"Go to my brothers and tell them",
"I am ascending to my Father and your Father",
"to my God and your God",
"Mary Magdalene came and informed the disciples",
"I have seen the Lord! And she told them what Jesus had said to her",
"On the evening of that day",
"the first day of the week",
"the disciples had gathered together and locked the doors of the place because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders",
"Jesus came and stood among them and said to them",
"Peace be with you",
"When he had said this",
"he showed them his hands and his side",
"Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord",
"So Jesus said to them again",
"Peace be with you",
"Just as the Father has sent me",
"I also send you",
"after he said this",
"he breathed on them",
"Receive the Holy Spirit",
"you forgive anyone’s sins",
"they are forgiven",
"you retain anyone’s sins",
"they are retained",
"one of the twelve",
"was not with them when Jesus came",
"The other disciples told him",
"We have seen the Lord! But he replied",
"Unless I see the wounds from the nails in his hands",
"put my finger into the wounds from the nails",
"put my hand into his side",
"I will never believe it!",
"Eight days later the disciples were again together in the house",
"Thomas was with them",
"Although the doors were locked",
"Jesus came and stood among them",
"Peace be with you!",
"Then he said to Thomas",
"Put your finger here",
"examine my hands",
"Extend your hand and put it into my side",
"Do not continue in your unbelief",
"Thomas replied to him",
"My Lord and my God!",
"Jesus said to him",
"Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are the people who have not seen and yet have believed",
"Now Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of the disciples",
"which are not recorded in this book",
"these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ",
"the Son of God",
"that by believing you may have life in his name",
"After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias",
"Now this is how he did so",
"the sons of Zebedee",
"two other disciples of his were together",
"Simon Peter told them",
"I am going fishing",
"We will go with you",
"they replied",
"They went out and got into the boat",
"that night they caught nothing",
"When it was already very early morning",
"Jesus stood on the beach",
"the disciples did not know that it was Jesus",
"So Jesus said to them",
"you don’t have any fish",
"do you? They replied",
"He told them",
"Throw your net on the right side of the boat",
"you will find some",
"So they threw the net",
"were not able to pull it in because of the large number of fish",
"Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter",
"It is the Lord! So Simon Peter",
"when he heard that it was the Lord",
"tucked in his outer garment for he had nothing on underneath it",
"plunged into the sea",
"Meanwhile the other disciples came with the boat",
"dragging the net full of fish",
"they were not far from land",
"only about a hundred yards",
"When they got out on the beach",
"they saw a charcoal fire ready with a fish placed on it",
"Bring some of the fish you have just now caught",
"So Simon Peter went aboard and pulled the net to shore",
"It was full of large fish",
"one hundred fifty three",
"although there were so many",
"the net was not torn",
"none of the disciples dared to ask him",
"Who are you? because they knew it was the Lord",
"Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them",
"did the same with the fish",
"This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead",
"Then when they had finished breakfast",
"Jesus said to Simon Peter",
"do you love me more than these do? He replied",
"you know I love you",
"Jesus told him",
"Feed my lambs",
"Jesus said a second time",
"do you love me? He replied",
"you know I love you",
"Jesus told him",
"Shepherd my sheep",
"Jesus said a third time",
"do you love me? Peter was distressed that Jesus asked him a third time",
"Do you love me?",
"you know everything",
"You know that I love you",
"Jesus replied",
"Feed my sheep",
"I tell you the solemn truth",
"when you were young",
"you tied your clothes around you and went wherever you wanted",
"when you are old",
"you will stretch out your hands",
"others will tie you up and bring you where you do not want to go",
"Now Jesus said this to indicate clearly by what kind of death Peter was going to glorify God",
"After he said this",
"Jesus told Peter",
"Follow me",
"Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them",
"This was the disciple who had leaned back against Jesus’ chest at the meal and asked",
"who is the one who is going to betray you?",
"So when Peter saw him",
"he asked Jesus",
"what about him?",
"Jesus replied",
"I want him to live until I come back",
"what concern is that of yours? You follow me!",
"So the saying circulated among the brothers and sisters that this disciple was not going to die",
"Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die",
"I want him to live until I come back",
"what concern is that of yours?",
"This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things",
"we know that his testimony is true",
"There are many other things that Jesus did",
"every one of them were written down",
"I suppose the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written
