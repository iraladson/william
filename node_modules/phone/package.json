  "readme": "## What is node-phone?\n`node-phone` is used to normalize the `mobile` phone number into a E.164 format.\n\nThe common problem is user normally input the phone number in this way:\n\n```\n`(817) 569-8900` or\n`817569-8900` or\n`1(817) 569-8900` or\n`+1(817) 569-8900` or ...\n```\n\nWhat we want is always:\n\n```\n+18175698900\n```\n\n##FAQ\n\n1. Does node-phone do any phone validation?\n\n\tYes: If you provide the 2nd parameter (country), and the phone number do not start with `+` sign.\n\n\t`phone` will validate `phone_number_lengths` and `validation_begin_with`\n\n\tNo: If the phone number start with `+` sign, even you pass the country.\n\n\t`phone` will simply remove all non digit and return `+XXXXXXXX` to you.\n\n2. Why some of the number is valid, but return null?\n\tThis npm is used to validate a mobile phone number for sending the SMS.\n\tSo, we try to match all possible rule, such as area code, number prefix, etc. to test if it is a mobile phone number.\n\tHowever, some countries, like USA, we can only check if it is a valid `AREA CODE`, there is no mobile phone prefix.\n\n\tFor UK, we know that mobile phone number is always start with `7`, in this case, this npm will be more helpful.\n\n3. Why do you make this?\n\n\tBecause we need to normalize the phone number for SMS notification for mobile phone only.\n\nWe don't validate if the number is mobile or not.\n\n\n## Install\n```\nnpm install phone\n```\n\n## Usage\n```\nvar phone = require('phone');\n\nphone('(817) 569-8900', ''); // return +18175698900\nphone('(817) 569-8900', 'USA'); // return +18175698900\nphone('(817) 569-8900', 'HKG'); // return null\nphone('+1(817) 569-8900', HKG); // return +18175698900\nphone('(817) 569-8900', ''); // return +18175698900\nphone('6123-6123', ''); // return null, as default country is USA\nphone('6123-6123', 'HKG'); // return +85261236123\n\n```\n\n\n## Test\n\n```\nnpm test\n\n``\n\n## Help\n\nWe try to google for many results, but none of package can fit our need.\nIf you know that our rule is wrong, or can add more validation to make this npm more accurate.\nPlease open an issue and let us know.\n\n## Change Log\n* 0.0.6\tAdded France mobile prefix `7`, updated USA, Canada area code.\n* 0.0.5\tPerformance tuning, updated Iceland mobile format to 7 digits only.\n* 0.0.4\tAdded US, CA area code to make it more accurate.\n\n\n## License\nMIT\n\n",
